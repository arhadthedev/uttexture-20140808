Version History

Author's Notes
--------------
This is an Unreal1 level modified by me, dinwitty for the
4 way ctf mod made by EntropicLiquid. (CTF+)
This level WILL work with the CTF4, and MultiCTF mods.
Dedicated CTFPlus Flagbases are removed and the standard flagbase is used.

Play with 2 to 16 players.

Changes in the level.

Buttons used for puzzle now do something else (gotta play it to discover!)
Doors opened by the buttons now open themselves and stay open after player opens them.
Door opened by defeating skaarj sequence opens itself.
A few surprises added to the level.

Unreal1 weapons/ammo/pickups left INTACT! as UT replaces them
except for some specific UT items added, so Unreal1/UT mods aughta work on it.

ShieldBelt from original level at start removed.

Some level tweaks to avoid falling into inescapeable traps.

No, you CANNOT get to the pickups behind the barriers! (like the original level)

Music order changes with flag grabs and captures.

Unreal4 music used and included in zip not supplied in UT.

I played with the idea of having a wandering Skaarj be a hazard, naw, I gave up.
Play as a Skaarj mutator.

As this design is, there are no discreet bases, just rooms, making this something like a DM-CTF.

There are no color spawns, everybody spawns anywhere, even next to the opponent flag.
It may seem odd you can grab a flag quick, but so can the opponent, so its a fast flag chase.

when setting game max score, set it around 20, scoring can be quick especially with multiflag captures.

Did you know about the Jumpboots in the original level? I didnt  8-}
They're there and grabable, (but thats the surprise)

Recommended Server Configuration (but use any desired!)
Gametype      :Hardcore 
Speed         :100%
Air Control   :35%
Translocator  :Yes
Mutator       :experiment!
Capture Limit :10-30
Timelimit     :20 (experiment!)
Weapon Stay   :Yes and no (for variation)
Friendly Fire :No (I find some people abuse this priviledge 8-P  )

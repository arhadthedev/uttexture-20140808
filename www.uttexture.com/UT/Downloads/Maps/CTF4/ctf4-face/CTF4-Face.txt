Author's Notes
--------------
Red_Dwarf:       Wow what can you say about Face that hasnt already been said...Er it rocks, nah thats been done.
		 Well I have looked at the bad points in Face and tried to solve them the best I can. Spawn snipers
		 was the main problem so I have added allot of spawn points at different positions and also off of the
		 floor so you dont get those annoying B'stards that wait there and kill you when you spawn. I thought
		 about moving them around the back of the base but that was really pointless as there are now bases 
		 to the side that can pick you off. Added a few bits and bobs here and there and also got rid of the
		 crappy health keg to a shield belt so you can see when someone has more health/armor than you now. :-)

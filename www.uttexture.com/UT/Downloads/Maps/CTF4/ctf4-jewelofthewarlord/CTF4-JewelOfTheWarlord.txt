Author's Notes
--------------
Ain't that a funky skybox? :D

I've modified the central hub for the map alot. There are no side entries now, and there is alot of health vials around. Make sure your team takes advantage of it. Also the water in the central area is there so you can get back on to the stair case. It also adds an element of risk to going for the health.

Finally, I removed the central altar and statue to reduce the polycount to a reasonable level.

Description             :In 2050 the Bio-Research company bought the rites to an astroid in order to do test on convering 
			 the Bio-waste into energy. First building two bases on top of the surface and then two in the caverns
			 underneath. One of the subterranian bases studied the bio-waste itself and the other studied the
			 electrical charge produced from the process. While the upper faculities were pretty much abandoned
			 the lower two were kept up too up to date and well maintained. Liandri bought the rites to the 
			 research center after a horrible flooding killed everyone below surface. The water was pumped into a lower
			 cavern below that was used for storage.

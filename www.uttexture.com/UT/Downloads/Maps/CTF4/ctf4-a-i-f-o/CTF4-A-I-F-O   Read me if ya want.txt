                     : 4 hours retweaking bits , this took a couple of extra hours 
                     : to convert to CTF4
============================================================================
Bot Support      : There is no bot support for this version mainly because I converted 
it for a Slaughter fest that was taking place round mine and we dont play with bots when 
theres real ppl to kill ;0)

Recommended Human Players  : 1 player on each side = a nice deathmatch but with flags ;0)
                           : 2 players on each side = Oi Team mate Get the Ficking flag back
                           : 3 players on each side = well you tell me 
============================================================================
Description: This is just a platforms , lifts and bouncers type platform .
If you`ve got no skill and like to play easy levels then this is not for you 
but if you`ve think you`ve got a bit of skill then you`ll like it .
Try picking up all 4 flags before returning to your own flag base if you think its
a bit easy ;0)
For those of you who wish to try from the redeemer platform if your good enough
you are able to reach all the flag bases some you need the jumpboots others 
ooh just try it.............. 
You will die lots of times before you will truely be able to say that youve 
mastered it Dr-Alf has the Most Suicides honour 80  in our stat chart guess
he could say Arse-I-Fell-Off quite a few times ;0)
                                
                                 N-Joy

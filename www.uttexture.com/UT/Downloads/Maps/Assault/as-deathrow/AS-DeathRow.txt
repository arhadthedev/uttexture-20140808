Description             : A massive prison break has occured from the maximum security
                          secret deathrow prison. Most prisoners left the prison and were 
                          captured outside the prison by police, however, some of the sickest
                          psychos chose to remain in the prison and torture and eventually 
                          kill the guards they kept alive. The Special Operations Team (SOT)
                          must enter the prison, neutralizing all resistance on sight and        
                          rescue the prisoners in as short as time as possible. 			
			  WARNING : some of the prisoners ahve computer skills and may have 
                          reprogrammed the security guns to fire on police insted of prisoners.                     
  				
Comments		: This map was originally made as a map for the SWAT mod for UT, but it
			  was deemed unacceptable by SWAT standards and I converted it to Assault
			  format. This is evident in teh way the level is designed (tons of cover,
			  small areas, all realistic)

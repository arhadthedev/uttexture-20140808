Base                    : new map from scratch 
Build Time              : around Six+ weeks
Editors used            : UnrealEd
 
Known Bugs              : None (hopefully)

New Code		: Space.u allows space walking and functioning Airlocks, also
			  includes Core Mover. I was not able to eliminate players & bots
			  from swimming through space without changing the Assault Code, 
			  but otherwise seems to work.

Bots			: You may notice that the bots do not defend the Radio Room, this 
			  is on purpose. The intent was to make a defending team either
			  Split forces between the Radio Room, the Torpedo Room, or 
			  Just Defend One or the other. After play testing I found that the
			  torpedo room seems easier to defend.

EPISODE V: The Incursion 

For the full story read the Story.txt

Fortunately for the IFE, the DRACS were successful in their counter strike. Having regained control of at least one of the moon outposts, they have destroyed the UFR's battleship Disruptor. One of the destroyers, the Justifier, has gotten away, but the second, the Incursion, was disabled during the destruction of the Disruptor.  

The Incursion has lost one of its warp pods, and another pod was severely damaged. With two pods offline, the Incursion could not light jump to safety. Knowing this, and realizing the ship contains Solnovian technology that the IFE can use against them, the crew of the Incursion has set about scuttling the ship by setting the warp core to overload. 

IFE intelligence has also learned of the UFR's second attack phase, to send in a fleet of destroyers should their first plan fail.  Once again, the IFE is counting on the DRACS to assault the destroyer Incursion and shut down the core before the ship can self-destruct. Once they have their hands on the Solnovian technology, they can then shut down the jump gate before the UFR can launch their second attack wave.

Author's Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I DON'T make myself vehicles on this map. I've found it on some German site which I can't recollect.

This map is not too big and hard to assault. There are only 4 objectives you need to complete.
I also used some new trees I taken from my UT\System directory (but I have a mod ThieveryUT which
uses it too).

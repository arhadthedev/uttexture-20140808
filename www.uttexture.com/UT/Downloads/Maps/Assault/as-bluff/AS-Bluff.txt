Description             : Assault edit of the Unreal map Bluff

Comments		: I must have suffered some sort of brain damage 
		and forgot how difficult the edit of TheSunSpire had been
		becaues I've had another go, this time with Bluff.  And yes,
		it was just as hard as the first time.  I think I did a bit 
		better a job with the bots this time though as they will
		actually complete the level in an all-bot team - eventually.
		They still can get stuck at certain points in the level 
		and are also very easily picked off with the sniper rifle.

		There are quite a few hidden compartments in the map so have
		a careful look round.  There is also a Redeamer in the map
		but it takes a while to reach it.  A lot of advantage can 
		be gained by hammer jumping a couple of the barriers so if
		the map gets a bit easy too attack play it with the hammer
		replaced by the chainsaw (Chairsaw arena mutator IIRC).
		AS-Bluff also tends to chug a bit on lower-end 
		machines - sorry about that.
		
		This WILL be my last SP edit though I will have a play with
		building a level from scratch and hell, I might even send it
		to Nali City if it looks good enough.

Note to Server Admins	:  Make sure that your server is set up to display
		creatures or else the Fish, Livestock and the friendly Nali
		ghost will not appear.

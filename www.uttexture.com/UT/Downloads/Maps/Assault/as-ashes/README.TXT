THE STORY:
The temple of krakor-Jaxx had served for thousands of years as a Mecca for all that worshipped Vandora, the goddess of Thunder.
After the Slave-utilizing Skaarj had been defeated by N.E.G. forces and Liandri mercinaries, the temple was altered by the Nali to include Human forms, and was then dedicated to the Humans who had proven themselves the best in the defeat of the Skaarj...their bodies, upon their final deaths, were creamated, and added to the Hall of the 1337...

...but when, at the critical signing of the Pact of Fryz'n-Koak, in the city of Threamus-Kateerz, by the beautiful, sparkling waters of the Prezzel'tix river, the signing of the Dor-Reah-Toz pact took place...Liandri lawers immediatly secured themselves in their clubhouse rec-room with nothing more than 7 bottles of Jack Danials and a large amount of Cheezy-Poofs....and determined that the pact gave them mining rights to the entire vally within which stood the temple of Krakor-Jaxx...and since the temple was constructed mostly of polished stone...dirt, in another form...and the precious Teridium used to ornament and illuminate the temple was, therefore, immbedded in the earth...it fell under the pact's mining agreement...Liandri could loot the temple of it's Teridium, legally...

However....the monks of the temple...having gotten word of their plans...have contacted a sliver group of Greenpeace, back on Earth...heavily armed from a recent National Guard Armory looting, they have set up a force field blocking the main bronze doors of the temple from attack...and have vowed to fight to the death.

Unfortunatley, the N.E.G. was not bribed enough to allow you to actually blow holes in the temple, and there is no suitable landing place for an air transport...so...

Your job is to enter, via translocation, into the temple...fight your way to the crystal that powers the force field...destroy it...pry open the bronze doors and open the wooden doors of the temple, so Liandri mercianaries and mining crews can do their job...your Acme "Res-O-Matic" regeneration units were all purchased from the sporting goods department at S-Mart (shop smart, shop S-Mart!) and are only good for 15 minutes, so get in, get out...fast...remember, millions in Executive bonuses are riding on this mission, so get in there and EARN your fifteen an hour!!!

A big thanks to all those at Nali City and Unreality BBS for putting up with my crap...this map is dedicated to all of them.

Thanks to Golgotha for letting me bounce ideas off him, and for all the sage advice!

Thanks, too, to Razor Sedge for his valuable input!!

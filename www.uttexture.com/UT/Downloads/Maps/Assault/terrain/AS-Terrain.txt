#--- Level plot & some hints ---

Plot
Intelligence services report that they have located the stolen state-of-the-art plasma
fuel consignment that needs to be destroyed so it can't be sold to the highest bidder.
A special service team has been sent to intercept the consignment.
The timetable and route of the train was known so an ambush was set, the
track was destroyed at the ambush point forcing the train to stop.


Mission
To destroy all mission objectives and destory all evidence taking no prisoners.

Deployment
Because of the hostile barren terrain, the special service team had to be dropped off
with their equipment at different locations surrounding the train.

Intelligence report
It is known that the train is defended by a special weapon housed on the second 
carriage so beware.

Hints

The plasma fuel itself is very explosive so Intelligence advises the use of genades
to destroy all targets.

For the three CRM movers stand just behind them a message will appear saying that
you now control the weapon, then standing still use your controls for the left/right
up/down movement to control where the weapon will fire, all weapons have alt and primary
firing, hope you like the Rocket.

The train has three ladders (invisible steps) to get up to various parts of it, hope you
can find them.

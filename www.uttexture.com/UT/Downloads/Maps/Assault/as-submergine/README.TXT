Description       : Destroy an already submerged submarine =O)
                    This is a high paced map with no actionless moments unless
                    somebody deliberately hides himself.
                    The map can easily carry 16 players but the starting scenario
                    becomes somewhat crowded then. An optimal player count would
                    be around 8.
                    Due to the high poly count on some areas (exceeds 250) some
                    low end 'puter owners may experience slow motion.

Known bugs              :The tractor beam won't work with certain mutators that alter the physics of the game. The 'suave' mutator is the only one I'm aware of (thanks to Alchemizt), but I'm sure there are others. Also, there are some 'decorative' weapons in the attacker's initial spawn area, and it will look a little funny when weapons mutators are used.

THE ARRIVAL

	"It's been 57 years since we first detected the alien star destroyer headed towards our home planet. All long-range scans of the vessel's armor and destructive weaponry indicate that their intent is hostile, and they have the abitlity to destroy our world.

	"We assembled the largest, most powerful fleet in history. We allowed the aliens to intercept falsified transmissions leading them to believe that the hub of our defensive grid is located on a small renegade moon on the outskirts of the solar system. We built a jamming device on the moon which, when activated, would temporarily disable the ship's engines and destructive weaponry, leaving them vulnerable to attack for 10 minutes.

	"However, the fleet was destroyed on route by an unexplained warp core breach in the flag ship. Those of us who were sent ahead to prepare the moon for battle are now the first and only line of defense. Our only vessel is an unarmed cargo ship. We have no long-range weapons, only side arms. Our only option is to infiltrate the ship and destroy it from within. We have made modifications to the jamming device which will, hopefully, activate the star destroyer's tractor beam and allow us access..."

Author's Notes
--------------
It's my first release. I learned about 95% of what i know about Ued during the building of this map. You'll be able to tell by the fact that some areas are quite 'newbie-ish' and others rise to astounding levels of mediocrity:)

Sorry about the suckulent bots. I tried everything, I swear. They know what to do, but you'll rarely lose a game, even at higher settings. If anyone wants to take a peek into ued and let me know WTF I'm doing wrong, please do.

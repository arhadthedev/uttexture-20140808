--- Theme ---

Based very losely on the map "Crossfire" for Half-Life.

Dunamis is the Greek word for "power".
It was four years ago that the Necris made it universally known that the founder of their religious beliefs
would return to them soon. Soon after their announcement they began to slowly "liberate" every sacred site
on every inhabited world they visited. Once arriving at a holy site they would exile or destroy any one who
was found there. Then they would set up an altar to their coming messiah which acted not only as a sort of
homing beacon, but also as a transmitter that detected and blocked any form of "spiritual" power that already
resided there. The altar would then be heavily guarded as the ionic field surrounding it was balanced in a
delicate field of invisible flux that held it together. If the energy field that surrounded any lifeform other
than the necris approached it, the flux would be damaged and the altar would explode leaving the necris in
deep trouble. The earth government was not interested in the activities of this group until a small planet
in one of the outer colonies was liberated. This particular planet was extremely old and the only thing holding
the  planer's core in place was the spiritual energy generated by the "Temple of Dunamis". Once the energy had
been disrupted by the Necris it was calculated that the planet would only be stable for one month, after which
collapse would be imminent. Your team has been sent in to eliminate the necris and "defile" their altar so
that the spiritual power can be restored to its former existence and purge the area of anything evil within
the city walls.

The entrance to the inner court is closed off by two switches which must be found within the city walls.
The entrance to the temple grounds is barred by large doors. The doors are held in place by a mechanism within the wall.
The only visible part of this mechanism is the two chains just above the main entrance. These must be destroyed to
gain admittance. Once entering the temple grounds your team must survive a mine field which can be de-activated
by another switch just inside the temple. Once inside the temple make your way down into the inner sanctum where
touching the altar will defile it after which it will self destruct allowing the city to be purged of the Necris.

There is 1 secret area in the map which consists of a small chapel which leads to a deadly secret!
The secret is found by pushing the book jutting out of the library shelves. The book triggers the trapdoor to open on the
other side of the area for a short while.

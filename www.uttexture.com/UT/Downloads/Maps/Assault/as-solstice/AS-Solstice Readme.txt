CONSTRUCTION
============

    Base                    : You are a member of an elite team chosen to infiltrate a 
                              remote (and almost overlooked) enemy fortress.  Intelligence 
                              has chosen this night, the Solstice, the longest night of the 
                              year, to send your team in under the cover of darkness.  Upon                               arrival, move quickly... our ships sail at dawn.

                              The fortress houses the pumps which supply power to an enemy 
                              controlled dam residing over the next ridge.  Your team must 
                              shut down the pump generators in order to disable dam control
                              systems.  This will release the flow of water and allow our 
                              ships access to the enemy base.

                              In order to gain access to the fortress, you will need to 
                              locate a toxin suit and destroy some of the pipes supplying  
                              pressure to the base.  The pipes can be located through an 
                              underground cave system which opens into the moat.  Once 
                              destroyed, the steam pressure will fall and the locking 
                              mechanisms on the doors will cease to function, allowing your
                              team access to the fortress.

                              Once inside, you must gain access to the rooftops, where the 
                              pumps are located.  Depressing two levers inside the fortress 
                              will open all remaining gates to the structure, including the 
                              main drawbridge, and the gate to the elevator tower.
   
                              Shut down the rooftop pumps and generator power will cease,
                              disabling the dam.

AUTHOR'S NOTES
==============

     This is my first Assault map... and one of the first Assault maps released for UT.  Interestingly enough, this map was released on the very day of the Winter Solstice heading into the new millenuim.  It wasnt planned that way, just a great coincidence.  Funny how things work out sometimes, eh?

Thanks go out to all my beta testers and advice givers, most notably EZKeel, Cyan, Spew, and my last minute saviour, Maxx3D!

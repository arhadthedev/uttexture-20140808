Description		:  This script is a modification of the code
			for the original Unreal monsters which allows
			them to be assigned teams in UT team games.

			To use them in a map either load the script
			into the actor browser or include it in the
			UnrealTournament.ini file under
			Editor.EditorEngine (EditPackages=TeamMonster,
			put it at the end).  You will find the monsters
			under Pawn/Staticpawn/Teamcannon/Teamscriptedpawn.
			They are under teamcannon so the bots will respond
			appropriately towards them.

			There is also a TeamCreatureFactory under 
			Keypoint/CreatureFactory and a TeamSpawnPoint
			under Navigationpoint/Spawnpoint.  These allow
			the creation of monsters which will respawn when
			killed.

			When you have put a TeamMonster in a map assign it
			to a team by using the "MyTeam" property under
			teamcannon (all the other teamcannon properties 
			are disabled however).  TeamCreatureFactories have
			MyTeam under TeamCreatureFactory.

			Please e-mail me when you release a map with
			TeamMonsters in it so I can have a play of it.

                        Version 1.1: Monsters can now be teleported
                        (thanks dinwitty). This version should work
                        with all maps made with the original.  This
                        version supersedes the one distributed in
                        AS-TheTower.

KNOWN Bugs              : Monsters on opposing teams will not target 
			each other except on damage or bump.

			Death messages are not printed for monsters.

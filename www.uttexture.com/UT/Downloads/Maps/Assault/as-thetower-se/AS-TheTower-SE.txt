Description             : Assault map featuring a tower surrounded by 
			lava, a wall and Unreal monsters on the 
			defending team.  Has both outdoor and indoor
			aspects.

			AS-TheTower is designed to be played with 
			weapon stay off.

Comments		:  I've made sure the poly count isn't too
			excessive so AS-TheTower will run well on 
			lower end systems.

			The custom sound file barbq.uax is a 
			collection of sounds from the Action Quake 2
			map "Actdam" by Bar-B-Q (bar-b-q@c-gate.net).

			Rim.umx contains "Beyond the Rim" which was 
			composed by D-Raven.

			TeamMonster.u is some Unreal Script I hacked up
			which allows the original Unreal monsters to be
			put into a map and assigned a team.  It also 
			works in ctf but I haven't tested it with 
			dom or dm teamplay.  Mappers are welcome to use
			TeamMonster.u in their maps as long as they tell
			me when the map is released (so I can play it)
			and include the TeamMonster.txt file with the
			map.  Also you are not allowed to make any money
			out of it (at least not without my permission).
			There is more info in the TeamMonster11.txt file.

                        The Special Edition features improvements in
                        gameplay against a bot-only team as well as
                        a couple of other minor graphical changes.
                        The bots are harder to snipe from the tower
                        and the Titan in gone - replaced with a
                        gasbag which respawns.

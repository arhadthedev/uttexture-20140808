-=[ Description ]=-

The setting takes place in a remote valley. In this valley is a large base built inside the side of the valley rock. Here
lies a small group of space pirates who have been known for ravaging the Delta Space Sector. You must find this base and 
destroy it leaving nothing behind.
As a attacker you must make your way to the high castle and set off a pair of two (red) 
switches in order to blow up the base. As a defender you must protect the base and the switches.

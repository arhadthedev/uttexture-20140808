Map Description:
In this Assault map you need to escape a prison (how origional  :P )
any way don't play this map if you come for the details (I suck at that this being my first AS map)   
but for the fun, The skaarj in this map are to help the attackers to escape but have friendly fire damage. The only little detailed thing is the city becouse I no longer cared about creating bsp cuts.
And Yipee there are none! (that I found)


Known bugs: 
1 The mercenaries are often distracted and no longer go for the switches, If that happens kill them
(they will respawn)
2 I could not make the final assault target so that everyone had to bet there 
(I tried movers to block the path but that did not work)

Author's Notes
--------------
Although ive got alot of other unfinished maps to work on this is one of those i "just had to do" the map
 itself is a fairly basic layout , but better than any of my previous assault attempts, the goal is to destroy 
the crystal you can see in the picture above, the map has a bit of a mixed feel to it , certain parts are modern 
and look almost futuristic, yet in other parts it looks like a cross between dm-curse and the early single
 player maps form quake 2 , bot play is pretty decent and they'll put up a fairly decent fight as long as 
there are enough of them :)

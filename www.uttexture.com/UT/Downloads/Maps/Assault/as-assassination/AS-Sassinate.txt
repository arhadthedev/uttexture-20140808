-=[ Notes ]=-

Even though this level is small, it will often take all of your allotted time
to complete the tasks. This assault level requires teamwork and sacrifice to succeed. 
If your usual playing style is lone ranger, you are not likely to do very well in it. 
Sniping is essential, regardless of which team you are on. Basically, open both 
outside gates by pressing the buttons by them, then choose one of 3 paths into the 
chamber where the Nali is being kept. Shoot the chain above him, and it is 
barbecue time. While it is not perfect, it is very fun to play, and that is in my 
opinion the most important feature of a level. 
*If you like this level, please vote for it in the Make Something Unreal contest. 
Thanks.

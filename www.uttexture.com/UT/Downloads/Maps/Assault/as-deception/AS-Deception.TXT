--- Story ---

Intrigues by the mystical abilities that the Nali race appear to possess, the government ordered "Black Ops"
to investigate this for possible military potential. Black ops drew up plans to capture a Nali family and create
a small Nali village. After being sedated and careful surgical removal of the abduction memories, the Nali would be
introduced to the fake village where they would be secretly scrutinized by scientific researchers.
The whole village was to be encased in a huge building where the walls would be lit by a hologramatic image of the sky.

The information has been leaked to a rival government which is disgusted by this immoral plan and has launched an
operation to destroy the village. The Nali village is very near completion. Your team will be smuggled into the last
cargo shipment where you must follow the following objectives.

1) Destroy the holo-emittor which is hiding the entrance to the base.
2) Switch on the secondary power core. This will enable your team to send the specific co-ordinates of the Nali village
   to a military strike force which will destroy the deception.
3) Disable the security system door clamps allowing access to the lower part of the control tower.
4) Enter the control tower and make your way to the com centre where the uplink to the strike force can be established.

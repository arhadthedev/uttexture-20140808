Description:
Some people - presumably, evil ones - have stolen the UT tropheys and you have to find them. That's for you come in a little boat to the island with high and well-guarded tower. I worked hard on this level, so it's well detalized, interesting and pleasant to see. I optimized player-starts, so you won't have to run kilometers every time you are killed. The map is best for 8 players. Assault time depends on players efficiency and luck and vary from 2 to 14 minutes, but I gave only 10, and it's quite possible to handle. (I would even say that it's a shame NOT to handle!) I also figured out all the objectives, so the goals are clear. Again, you won't have to wander for hours searching for a lever switch, in MY map you are right in the middle of the battle.

Thanks to:
T.Ahlen (AS-Atlantica) for the boat, which is, frankly speaking, partially reconstructed

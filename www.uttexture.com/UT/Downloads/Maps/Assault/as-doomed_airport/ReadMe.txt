Author's Notes
--------------
This is my first attempt at an assault map, and I'm damn proud of it!
Sorry this level wasn't out earlier, I would have released it mid july  but I needed a change from mapping.
This level was originally going to be a Death-Match map located in a mall, but I got sick of making DM maps.

NOTICE:  IF YOU PLAYED THE BETA VERSION OF THIS MAP, YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE
THE FILE "ResurrectTex.utx" in your textures folder.  The old one from the beta
should be discarded.  If you do not do this, you will get mismatch errors when
you attempt to play online, and some textures in the game will be missing and
look an ugly green.

=============================================================================

-=[ Installation ]=-

Unzip the .zip file.  Look in your UnrealTournament directory.
The .unr file goes in your MAPS folder, the .aux file goes in your SOUNDS
folder, and the .utx file goes in your TEXTURES folder.  Voila!

===============================================================

-=[ Description ]=-

The Warlock's Tower has remained dormant for decades, taken over by the
forces of Order long ago, when the Warlock was imprisoned in death.  Now
is the time for our master to rise again, and we will take back what is
rightfully ours and spread the reign of Chaos to all lands.

My first AS map for UT, even the BETA was received very well it seems
and I found it on servers everywhere.  I can only hope that people enjoy
my work, for I'll continue to make more of it.  My goal as a mapmaker is
to make something OTHER than the usual warehouse and cramped indoor levels- I want atmosphere.  I hope I succeeded.

I designed this map to give defense more of an edge than usual, you won't get any 30 second matches here!  The map should be FULLY bot
compatible, and provide a decent challenge.  As always, I love feedback!
I want to know what YOU think, for better or worse- that's the only way
to improve!  And I also even implement a lot of suggestions for maps
in development.


========================================================================

Changes from Beta 0.2 to Final 1.0

1.  Ending sequence added.
2.  Steps added to both mausoleums.
3.  Brightened ambient light.  I did not *want* to do this, but I realized
that people using software rendering are seeing a lot darker version than what
I'm seeing with 3dfx.
4.  Added location tags.
5.  Changed various aspects of lightning.
6.  Added a few secrets.
7.  Added various sound effects.
8.  Added jumpboot ledges.
9.  Made bells audible from the ground.
10.  Improved bot paths, creating more believable charges, and randomized some
paths.
11.  Improved flames.
12.  Added various inventory.
13.  Added short invisible barrier next to ground teleporter, to prevent
accidentally warping in and running right off the cliff by accident.
14.  Lots of little things.
15.  Changed triggerlights and some triggers to AlwaysRelevent.  I HOPE this
prevents a mess that I've had in the past with DmEther, where special effects
get messed up online, even if they work fine in solo play.  I'll keep a watch
on it.

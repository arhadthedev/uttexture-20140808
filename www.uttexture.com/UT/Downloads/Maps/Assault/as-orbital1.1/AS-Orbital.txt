--- Play Information ---
Game                    :UnrealTournament
Level Name              :Orbital Space Station
Gameplay Style          :Assault
New Sounds              :nope
New Graphics            :level screenshots only
NewUnrealScript         :no
Bugs                    :probably..
			 A few small areas where the skybox shows through
                         (the design is a bit too adventurous for a first
                         attempt at level design!!!) 

--- Construction ---
Editor(s) used          :UnrealEd, Amapi, a wing and a prayer
Base                    :None - built from scratch
Construction Time       :2 and a half months (very conservative estimate!!!)


--- Installation ---
copy the AS-Orbital.unr file to your unrealtournament/maps directory


--- Gameplay notes --- (deep breath...)
Defenders can try stopping the attackers reaching the second quadrant block
by sniping them across the outer ring. If an attacker makes it past the last
window on the outer ring then the defenders should use the teleporters to
travel into the second quadrant block to head them off and protect the blast
door fuses. There are two autocannons in the second quadrant block to assist
the defenders. Attackers need to shoot the two fuses to open the blast doors
Once the blast doors have been opened the defenders should try to stop the
attackers from reaching the door at end of the corridor. If they reach this
the autocannons will deactivate and the attackers will spawn in the second
quadrant block. Defenders should then try to keep the attackers in the inner
corridor . Once the attackers have reached the end of the inner corridor the
defenders should try to protect the four reactor controls. The attackers
must deactivate all four controls to destabilize the reactor and gain access
to the main hangar bay. A well aimed rocket can blast an ememy off the
walkways to the reactor controls into oblivion. Once all reactor controls
have been deativated then the attackers spawn point moves again closer and
the defenders spawn in the hangar bay. Defenders then have to stop the
attackers reaching the escape shuttle.

6 to 12 players seem to work best, any more and it gets a bit too frantic..


--- Author's Notes ---
This is my first level so constructive feedback is welcome. If you find
anything weird (or plain stoopid) or if you like what I've done please email
me and let me know.

Although I don't think it exceeds the 350 node/160 poly guide limits, the
poly count is pretty high throughout the level (need to work on my zoning
and detail levels) so it needs a reasonably powerful machine. It runs fine
on my PIII 550 +128Mb RAM +TNT and my Bro's Celeron 400 +128Mb RAM +Voodoo2.

The AS-Orbital.unr file weighs in at hefty 19.4Mb, dunno why, all other
similar sized maps seem to be around 3 to 4 Mb, still it zips up ok. Might
cause problems for users with 64mb or less.

                              The Story

     The year is 2342...The Tournament champion "Xan" has managed through his Liandri connections, wealth and fame (and later on through graft, propoganda and outright murder)
to gain almost complete control of Earth and most of her off-world colonies.  He has
declared himself emporor.

     Unfortunately, on Earths oldest and most settled colony, Mars, the ancient 
idea of self-determination has again reared it's head...and a self governing republic 
has been formed declaring itself free of Xan's benevolent rule.

     This threat would normally be of no concern, given the size of Xan's warfleet...but
the crafty Mars rebels have an ace in the hole.  At a far-flung, distant colony of 
humankind exists a branch office of the old Union Areospace Corporation...well known for that "incident" of 2154 where half of Earths population was nailed, and for being the only corporation unable to purchase employee health benefits anywhere in the known galaxy.
It was here that the Mars colonies purchased The Lulupea.

     The Lulupea is a Galaxy class warship with nuclear capability and one important
extra...it is entirely sheathed in a thin layer of crystal clear neutronium...indestructable.

     Luckily, Xan has managed to obtain the technical readouts of the ship by offering
U.A.C. joint dental coverage, and a plan of attack has been made.

     Your job is to teleport into the ship and attack it from within...make your way to
the ships pilot-house and shut down the auto-pilot....bring freedom from choice back
to the duped martian colonist by allowing Xan's "freedom fleet" to leave hyperspace and
liberate Mars!!...Xan himself has bravely chosen to stay on his flagship and fire
tactical nukes at the Lulupea to disrupt the defenders, so don't let him down!!

A big HI to everyone at Unreality....and yea, Lulu, I know it took a long time, but 
assault levels are murder......and HIYA SALLY!!

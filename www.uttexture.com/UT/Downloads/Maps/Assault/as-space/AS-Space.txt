>>>Author's Notes<<<
This is my 3rd try at an assault map...i finally go he hang of screenshots and adding textures
you,ll probably notice a few ripped of quake3 textures :)might as well put them to good use hehe
the map isnt overly hard but with a lot of peole can take awhile.very open areas for a big bloodfest
the tricky bit is to get throught he teleporter without fragin each other :)its hard but i like it that way

Bugs
----
A HOM bug in one cell and bot movement (if you want to check the rest of the cell room,
you'll have to order the bots to attack, otherwise, they'll stuck in the middle of the chamber)

Author's notes
--------------
Try it with 10 to 16 players.
In the ship, you'll find two other enemies: The Guards (SkaarjOfficers) who can be
found in the NavChamb and the Officers (Mercs) in the small cargo area. They keep
regenerating so... show'em where to stick it.

Other levels
------------
DM/DOM/CTF-Vortex2
Actually these four (including the AS) are my first creations. The original Unreal has a 
great architecture and interesting places to visit (and fight in, why not?), so I
believe that a UT game mode conversion will result in nice stuff.

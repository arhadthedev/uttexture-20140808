Why two maps?

Well, one of them is a multiplayer version only (no bots), and the other is a single player version.  I decided that a large zip file was the lesser of two evils than the confusion of two seperate zip files.
So, here you should have:

AS-Planeshifter.unr  (the multi-player map file)
AS-PlaneshifterSP.unr (the single player map file)
AscTex.utx (the texture file used by both maps)
and various .txt readmes.

Each readme contains various points specific to that version of the map.
Look there for details!

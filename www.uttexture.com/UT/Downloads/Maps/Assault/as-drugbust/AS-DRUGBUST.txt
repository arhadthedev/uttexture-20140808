Information
------------
   
  Terry Cox wanted to create an Assault with a realistic setting, lots of ways in to get the objectives,
  make good use of air hammer and rocket launching, multi size battle areas and of course with all my maps a high body count!  
  Also to win this map team work is a must, there won't be any heros!

Happy Assaulting OSMIUM...& Skyhawk...

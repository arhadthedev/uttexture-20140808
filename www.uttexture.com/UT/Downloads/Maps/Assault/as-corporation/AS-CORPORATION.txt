Information
------------
   
  I wanted to create an Assault with a futuristic setting, futuristic weapons, several objectives, multi size battle areas and of course with all my maps a high body count!  
  Also to win this map team work is a must, there won't be any heros!

Happy Assaulting OSMIUM...

Easy, you know how.

Author's Notes
--------------
These level was designed to be fairly simplistic really meant for human play for true team work,
but bots work too.  It has a different feel from the traditional assault maps where you basically 
run around and blow stuff up.  It is meant to be more of a team deathmatch with a some extra
objectives.  It requires caution and stealth along with skill with the gun.
There is meant to be a large amount of players to keep the action going and to 
create a large team feel.  Made for both normal assault and infiltration.  
This is my first released map so any suggestions/ideas are welcome.

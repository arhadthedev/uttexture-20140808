Description             :After your team destroys the missile silo on mars and escapes
in the pod you recieve a disturbing transmission from Earth,it,s sketchy and seems to lack power but what you make out forces you
to change direction from the moon base straight to earth..
"to any troops still in th quadrant..the base...attack....brood has got a foothold
in new city outside th spacedock..inuit gaurds have been modified to fight...for the brood queen...
doesnt look good...times running out...mothership..on radar getting closer..i,m out of ammo and food
i,m all thats left..if you can here me..please....help"END Transmission"
but just as the radio died out you heard screaming a terrible shrill animal howl
that chilled you to the bone...the captain orders an immediate ready status and hurtles you into the unknown..
Your loved ones and home are under attack and you MUST defend them..buckle up grunts..its time to do what you were born to do.

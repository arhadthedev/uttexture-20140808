Title : DOM-Anka
Version : Variant of DMAnka, Unreal's DeathMatch level.
Release Date : 20-03-00
Filename : DOM-Anka
Author(s) : Original map by Sidney Rauchberger (Dominated by topaz)
Email Address : kbmindkeep@hotmail.com
Description : I just love ancient maps. Anka, is such one. Another small map for 6-8 players, that can give you a nice idea about what Domination is all about. And of course, the Aztec textures are done perfect by the magic hands of Sidney.

Remember: The map is made by Sidney Rauchberger. I (topaz) simply made it Domination. He is the great mapper, not I. :) 


IF you like this conversion, I strongly suggest you to download the DOM-Pack that I have made, that includes some of the most interesting DOM-conversion that you can find over UT community. I also see many times that maps from this DOM-Pack, are played over the internet: DOM-GrooveMachine, DOM-Siberia and DOM-Ariza are the most popular. 

Dominate the Aztecs!
If you like the Aztec theme, then hold on: I am prepering a DOM-AztecPack with ten Domination maps that are gonna leave you sleepless! DOM-SunPyramid is included at the DOM-AztecPack, and so is DOM-Anka. For convinion reasons, the maps are gonna released seperatly and also together, as DOM-AztecPack.zip. You choose what method you like most.
Oh, the maps that DOM-AztecPack will include (so you can find the seperatly:):
DOM-SunPyramid
DOM-Anka
DOM-Aztec
DOM-CorridorsofChameleons
DOM-AztecArena
DOM-Olden][
DOM-Tagar
DOM-Toooom
DOM-Torture

The maps are subject to change, according to their quality outcome.

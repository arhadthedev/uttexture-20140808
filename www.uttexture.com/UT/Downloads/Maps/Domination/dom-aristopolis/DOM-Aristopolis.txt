Description : Nice and small Domination map for your pleasure!

Remember: The map is made by Raimond Kuhlman. I (topaz) simply made it Domination. He is the great mapper, not I. :) 


IF you like this conversion, I strongly suggest you to download the DOM-Pack that I have made, that includes some of the most interesting DOM-conversion that you can find over UT community. I also see many times that maps from this DOM-Pack, are played over the internet: DOM-GrooveMachine, DOM-Siberia and DOM-Ariza are the most popular. 

Dominate the Aztecs!
If you like the Aztec theme, then hold on: I am prepering a DOM-AztecPack with ten Domination maps that are gonna leave you sleepless! DOM-Aristopolis included at the DOM-AztecPack. For convinion reasons, the maps are gonna released seperatly and also together, as DOM-AztecPack.zip. You choose what method you like most.
Oh, the maps that DOM-AztecPack will include (so you can find the seperatly:):
DOM-SunPyramid
DOM-Anka
DOM-Aztec
DOM-CorridorofChameleons
DOM-ArcaneTemple
DOM-Olden][
DOM-Tagar
DOM-Toooom
DOM-Aristopolis
DOM-LohmannsLair

The maps are subject to change, according to their quality outcome.

Look for my next ctf/dom/dm level titled Phobos67.

Misc Comments: The catwalks seem very narrow, however if you look youll notice they are about 5 and a half player widths across providing plenty of room to dodge, just watch where the hell your stepping:-). The level was created in a cyberpunk theme with heavy influence from anime movies.

Dom Shivas Keep Readme

I'm not too familiar with the proper format of a readme.  Here's some technical words...um...t-joint...er...bulkhead...1000 gigobikes....

Shivas Keep, my first map, was a great introduction to the editor, and I'm still in awe at all the possibilities unrealed offers.  My wife and I are currently trying to get a childrens mod located on a pond where the characters are dragonflies and frogs and such.
As well, I don't do a renovation without doing it in unreal ed now.
I gotta make the dead line for this map, but I'll wrtite up a blurb on it and put it on my web page.

Thanx

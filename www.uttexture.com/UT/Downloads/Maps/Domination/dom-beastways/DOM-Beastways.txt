Author's Notes
--------------
Man, I'm really glad to have this level finished. Endless construction time but at last the
level is not very big. Well but I guess this is my best level. A temple like ambience and
some cool locations compared with fucking good gameplay. But enough to the words play and
enjoy!!! Oh yeah: didn't see any bugs!

DOM-Octagon by null

this is my first map I would just like some feedback to be sure I am doing things right. I do not know how to set up a screenshot for in the menu, so it has none. another thing I have not quite figured out yet is pathnodes. ahh, well, thanks for your time I hope you like the map. the recommended number of players is 8 (any more and you'll die spawning sometimes).

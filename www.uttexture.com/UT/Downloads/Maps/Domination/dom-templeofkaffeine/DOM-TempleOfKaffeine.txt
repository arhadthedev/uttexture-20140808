	After playing the UT demo I knew I'd be making levels for the final
	version of the game, and sure enough I did.  This is my first level, 
	though certainly not my last.  The layout is actually taken from one
	of my old Decent levels, "Kaffinated".  Those of you who played it
	might recognize the Tent room, though everything else is new.
	I didn't know what game mode I should design it for, but about half
	way in the making I decided that this would make a good Domination
	level, and I think it turned out nicely.

	I spent a lot of time optimizing this level and trying to make
	everything perfect.  In fact I spent 6 hours alone just trying to
	squeeze a few more FPS out of the map.  The end result is a bit less
	decoration, but more playability.  Side note: sometimes getting the
	BSPs right without screwing up your level can be a pain in the neck!
	Good thing I saved under 2 different files!

	Thanks to all of those who's tutorials I've read, especially those at
	UnrealEd.com.  Also thanks to Epic for a great game!

Author's Notes
--------------
Red_Dwarf:       I enjoyed working on the CTF version so much I decided to do a DOM conversion of this as well.
		 I changed allot of textures, brushes and generally learnt from the weakpoints of the CTF version.
	         CTF-Deck16]I[ was a good project to work on but this map was solely my project and therefore a little 
		 more gratifying to see complete. Hope you all enjoy the map and look out for my DM conversion :-)

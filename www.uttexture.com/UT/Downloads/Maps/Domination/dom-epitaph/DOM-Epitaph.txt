Author's Notes
--------------
This is my first domination and is IMO the best map I've made so far.  I got a lot of inspiration for it from CliffyB's map Gearbolt.  All the good items are there, Redeemer, Shieldbelt, invisibility, and keg o' health.  I am very happy with the way this map came out and hope you enjoy it. /Z

Story
---------
Edmond Baethorn was a fledgling arena designer for what we would call the "farm leagues" of Liandri's Deathmatch games.  Liandri Co. noticed the potential in Baethorn's style of design and hired him to construct arenas for the tournament.  Unfortunately while Baethorn was walking around going over little details of his new arena (the one you're about to play), he  tripped over the shock riffle in the reactor core room and fell into the energy beam which supplied power to the arena.  Needless to say, no remains of Baethorn could be recovered.  Liandri Co., in a unusual act of remorse and respect, dedicated Baethorn's nearly finished arena to him as an act of rememberance.  This new arena became Baethorn's grave, tombstone, and Epitaph.

I'm well aware of the "issues" here. But it is fairly playable and I wanted to use one of the better 
conversions I'd made learning UED to learn how to navigate the upload features on sharing sites. So here it is.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Place the *.unr file in your \UnrealTournament\maps directory.



Known Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bots sometimes ignore the "Tower" control point. 
Bots sometimes get stuck in the well.

Stay tuned. More (better) stuff coming.

 
Copyright/Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given as I ripped this from Myscha for practice in UED and am now 
releasing it it without permission to see if I can figure out Nali City 
and Fileleech's FTP's, I'd be something of a hypocrite to say anything 
here, wouldn't I? Don't redistribute this for Profit. Period.

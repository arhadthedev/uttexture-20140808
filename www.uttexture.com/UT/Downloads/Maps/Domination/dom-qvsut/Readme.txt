Extended description:
--------------------
Inspired by all the hype of competetion between quake and unreal tournament.
Started out as a deathmatch board.    (dm-king)
my 2nd map ever      but much better than the first one. (dm-supernova)
best played with 8-16 players. 
bots dont like to jump some platforms.

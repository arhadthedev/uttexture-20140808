--- Description ---
This is quite a small level but it plays quite well. It is based on an asteroid spinning around in space. There are no structures apart from a space ship that has landed.



--- Author's Notes ---
This map plays well, but don't expect anything brilliant, this map only took about 2 hours to build.

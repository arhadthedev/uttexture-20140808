To play this map you'll have to install Surface.umx from Unreal to UT's \Music directory. 

Finally, my old shitty DOM-GoreJungle has been totally screwed! G.O.R.E. Jungle Special Edition is 
totally unique and features new technologies! Prepare for breath-taking atmosphere and realistic terrain 
that kicks ass! And bugs? Dead! All of them! Just load this map with many players (20 start locations) 
and hunt your enemies down! 4 control points, nice bot gameplay (although they sometimes get confused, 
but blame Epic for the AI) and pretty smooth gameplay. I own a P3, 256MB, Voodoo3-3000 and I noticed that 
fps were decreasing only in the great fall/river cross area (due to the fog effect perhaps) and even then, 
movement was not getting awfully choppy. It appears that UT engine is still alive and kicking. 

 

*You will need the following packages in order to run the map properly:

Textures (UTX): Botpack, city, Detail, Editor, Engine, GenEarth, genfluid, GenFX, GenIn, Indus5, Indus6, 
LadrArrow, Liquids, ShaneDay, ShaneSky, SkyBox, SkyCity, UBrowser, UMenu, UnrealI, UnrealShare, UTtech1, 
UTtech3, UTMenu.
Sounds (UAX): AmbAncient, AmbModern, AmbOutside, Announcer, BossVoice, Botpack, Female1Voice, Female2Voice, 
Laddersounds, Male1Voice, Male2Voice, UMenu, UnrealI, UnrealShare, UTMenu.

Extended description:
--------------------------------------
Based on the brilliant series of Multiple Universe novels by golden age science fiction master 
Phillip Jose Farmer, 'Alofmethbin' includes far more than just the one pocket universe
of that name. Included also are the famous 'Lavalite World', 'Urizen's Universe' and 
even the artificial universe that is Earth.

The story behind all of this is that some 50 millenia in the past, pocket universes were
manufactured to suit the whims of an untold number of customers. These universes, ruled by
their immortalized Lords, gradually fell into ruin as their human masters gradually went insane
from both the power of playing gods, and from the complexities of immortality. Now the Lords
play deadly games with each other, trying to kill each other off, and risking death in return,
with the pocket universes themselves as the ultimate prize! 

This Unreal Tournament level is directly based on the 'Tiers' series of books 
by Philip Jose Farmer:

The World Of Tiers
A Private Cosmos
Behind The Walls Of Terra
The Lavalite World
More Than Fire

These books have also been collected in collection form by Guild America Books
with 'More Than Fire' published by Tor

Phillip Jose Farmer is one of the most respected science fiction authors in the world, a contemporary
of such notables as Issac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. Good luck finding his works, though,
in an age where 'sci-fi' about 'elves in space' dominates the marketplace. 


Author's Notes
--------------
There is, as mentioned no attempt whatsoever to even imagine bots working with this level.
I did try, however, but the process is hopeless. 

In this level there are countless secrets, including an entire hidden universe. Each pocket universe
is not only vast, but also has unique physics...in some universes the gravity is so strong that stepping
off a curb will kill, and universes where everything is slippery. There is a universe with a planet
built like a tower of Babel, and a universe of floating blobs of earth. These are just for starters.
Amidst the universes are five -rather than the usual three- domination points, and more will be required
of the player than simply running about blasting away. This is not intended to be a fast frag map,
and I make no apology for this: there is enough room in the vastenss of Unreal Tournament for a severe
challenge of tactics. Multiple universes fit that bill.

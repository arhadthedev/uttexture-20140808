Description             : The first so-called "Hall of Giants" was discovered on the planet 
                          Euphrates (Omicron Eridani III).  The site was built on a scale
                          much larger than human, and apparently (based on the omnipresent
                          green lighting) was intended to be viewed by eyes used to a different
                          part of the spectrum.  Or perhaps it was meant to be some bizarre form
                          of alien aesthetics.  Whatever the reason, it was purchased by Liandri.

                          The Hall of Giants proved to be so popular as a Capture the Flag
                          arena that Liandri formed a special division to search for similar
                          sites throughout known space.  Ironically, the next one they found
                          was actually on Euphrates as well, antipodal to the first Hall, submerged 
                          beneath the planet's liquid oxygen ocean.

                          This second Hall was done in a more subdued blue color; fortunately not so
                          saturated that the standard team colors could not be distinguished.  Liandri
                          converted it into a Domination arena, in the hopes that it would prove to be 
                          just as popular with that crowd.  Only time will tell...
			  
Other levels by author  : A whole bunch of unreleased levels, mostly not oriented 
                          towards playability.  Refer to my mapfinger page if that
                          makes no sense to you, one or two have been released there.

--- Installation ---
Unzip the .unr file into your UnrealTournament/maps/ directory.

are like me; it helps me remember what levels I've gotten).


Author's Notes
--------------

* The teleporters are sort of lame in a "tube" style map, but adding new tubes (or pretty much any new geometry) has just created problems, so this is probably here to stay.

* Three of the four control points (the flag bases and the tube station) are not zoned.  This is somewhat problematic on a big open map like this (tried effectively sealing off the opposite ends of the map as zones, but it just caused more pesky invisble walls and such)


Update History
--------------

0.4  -  Level Released

0.3  -  This will likely be the penultimate version.  The map is probably as complete as it is going 
	to get, geometry-wise, unless there are major bugs.  I tried lowering the roof of the map to 
	improve performance, but the way it was created makes this difficult (the major brushwork 
	hadn't been permanently transformed, making it hard to clip, and doing so now seriously screws 
	up the texture alignment).  It could still be done, but the map works as well as the CTF version
	for me, so I have no problems with the way it is now.

	Walkways added from the two new bridges to the Upper Control Point bridge.

	Upper bridge weapons and such tweaked.  Health added as well (intentionally distant from the CP).

	Put the shield belt back in (no idea how it got removed).

	Changed the music after I waited longer than I estimated for a friend of mine to help me playtest
	the level and I got sick of hearing nether.umx
	

0.2a -	Updated Alpha version.
	Weapons added to upper bridge (can't believe I hadn't done that yet)
	Fixed bots not going to the upper control point (either adding the weapons or some path nodes fixed it).
	Added a bridge one "column" away from the Upper platform control point bridge in each direction, with weapons and transporters.
	Added lights to the transporters under the ramps.

0.1a -	Initial Alpha version released, using the only copy that I have that has no known "invisible walls" or HOM.

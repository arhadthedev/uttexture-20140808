Well..

This is my second level now...and I think this one is a blast(although I'm probably a little bias).  I know domination maps by nature aren't very realistic...(because respawning is almost a necessity)...but this map is fun w/ only one life aswell.

I've found that the bots are much harder in infiltration mode(at least on this map?)...so if you need easier bots(even on novice they are quite precise and you will die many times!)...you can play regular UT mode w/ speed turned down to 65%(you will have an enforcer, but all the weapons in the level are infiltration even in regular mode anyway...and you can configure the bots w/ infiltration skins.)

I kind of like these small maps...but I think I am going to try something bigger next time.

If the maps I am sending(I sent one earlier this week CTF-Guerilla) are a little cheasy for what you normally post let me know so I can improve my skills before submitting more...so I don't waste your time.

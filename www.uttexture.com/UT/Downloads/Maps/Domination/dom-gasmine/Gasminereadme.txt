Description             : retired gasmining platform in deepspace - don't ask me about gas in space,
			  i don't ask about people who can respawn after spreading their limbs all
			  over the place :)
			  The map may be a bit to detailed, so it can be that it will not run well
			  at slower systems. I played with the Bezier-Function at the 2D-Shape-Ed.
			  :) Slow but full of bends :)

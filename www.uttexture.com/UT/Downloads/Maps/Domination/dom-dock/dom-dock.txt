This map is tricky. You're trying to control 3 points in this dock of hazard. There is a Sea Shack, a Docking Bay and a Rooftop. The roof is where some of the most valuable goodies are.
The map can run a bit on the slow side, but it won't be a problem for superfast computers. All you do when you download this is to simply extract the map onto the maps folder in C:\UnrealTournament. 
(You can do whatever the hell you want with this readme file.) 

Other maps by me, soon to be released:

DM-Upsidedown
DM-Purgatory
DM-Aquarius
DM-Junkyard
DOM-Alleys
DM-Cellblock

....and any others if I decide on it. I'll make a website soon. 

Happy fragging!

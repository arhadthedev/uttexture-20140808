Installation

   Unzip the the files.  DOM-Deck16][.unr goes in the "Maps" directory.

Author's Notes
--------------
Many DM maps can be converted to Domination with just a few tweaks.  
Deck16][ is a classic DM map, and so I thought I'd convert it to a DOM map 
so that Domination fans can enjoy the map in their favorite game mode.  
Deck16][ really shines as a Domination map because the translocator is 
enabled by default, and you can just fly like a trapeze through this 
wonderfully open map.

The Control Points cater to three different playing styles: 

- The Control Point in the Dead End is very defensible, and players who 
like to have their feet solidly on the ground will enjoy the battles to 
conquer and defend this Point.  The goop gun will come in handy here.  When 
you assault this Point, be careful since there may be a bot or two camping 
in the shadows on defense.

- The Control Point on the catwalk over the Slime Pool is for players who 
have mastered precise mobility; they will enjoy the thrill of walking the 
tight rope above the deadly slime, and they can translocate with such 
precision that they can translocate exactly to this Control Point without 
falling into the pool.

- The Control Point on top of the Boxes in the central area is the main 
focus of contention.  This Control Point switches hands the most, and the 
best way to defend it is to translocate on top of the high boxes where the 
shock rifle is and guard it from that vantage popint.  This is the Control 
Point for fast action, and players who like fast paced deathmatch will enjoy 
fighting around this Control Point.

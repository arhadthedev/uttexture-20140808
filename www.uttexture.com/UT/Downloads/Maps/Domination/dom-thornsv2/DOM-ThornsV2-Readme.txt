DOM-Thorns V2

Original Author: [XA]PsychoP@t & [XA]Defiance

OK, ok, I think I'm closing in on the very ESSENCE of the Thorns experience, but it occurred to me that the Thorns concept had a hidden flaw.  This, the latest Thorns offering to the UT community, is much, much closer to what Thorns gamers really want, but it's not... quite... there.  The useless bits at the ends of the map are gone now, but the rest... hmm.  Maybe I'm just imagining it, maybe I have finally honed the concept to perfection.

Regardless, Thorns lovers WILL enjoy this map, I guarantee.  You can't get too much of a good thing.  Let us all give praise to the mappers whose spectacular collaboration has yielded this bounty - [XA]PsychoP@t & [XA]Defiance.  There was something else that I wanted to say...  Oh, yes- "I got da mad skillz".


To install simply copy the DOM-ThornsV2.unr file in UT map directory.

Or get some help, but I think you can do it on your own.

This is my second map DOM-Sadistic. an interactive map full of movers,
which i initially only used to practice building movers and triggers.
There are many traps in the level, but all are dodgable somehow (im not
gonna tell you how, HAHA). if u complain u cant dodge the u have NO SKILLZ AT ALL!
Bot tend to screw themself up in the traps, but not too much. the bots have another
problem, if you choose 2 you get 4. i play this with 2 bot (4 in map)
All the movers work flawless exept one, but it is not annoying if u get used to it.

Should be cool for lan parties (but i think they're sad)
The music comes from as-ruins, which lend it from DOM-Ancienttitan (i looked this all up)
. I credit the author for the music which helps a great deal in creating the ambience.
I think its clear that one should put the map in the MAPS directory and the umx file 
in the MUSIC directory

Hope you will enjoy it. if you did (or didnt at all) please provide me feadback via an
Nalicity comment.
Please no comments on my english (it sux)

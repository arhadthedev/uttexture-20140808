Extended description:
--------------------------------------
The year is 1969. It's the 'Future That Was' aboard the Super Ultra Groovy "MOD
Station Five", the swinginest place in Near Earth Orbit! Only...something has
gone wrong and very un-60's mayhem ensues!

This is an effort to create the rounded, curving, sterile white with primary colors
world of cheesy 60's Sci-Fi and Spy-Fi motion pictures. High budgets but silly design
made for wasted space, but cool curves and flowing shapes. If you have seen a 60's French
or Italian space movie, you will be at home in Mod Station Five!



Author's Notes
--------------
This is my first attempt Domination map. I tried to create an unusual
environment, with some unusual physics and strategies. There are many special features 
about this map, such as air ducts to crawl through! 

The great amount of curvature should be noted, as it is rare in Unreal maps, and the 
careful use of color, light, and space. There are wide open regions mixed with narrow,
claustophobic tunnels. There are areas of differing gravity, and some very unusual
views.

I have tried also to make the layout of the space station follow some sense of order,
though in a wacky 60's kind of way. Many people make space station levels, and always
they are dark, brooding, and moody places. Deep shadows and almost gothic design.
This map is an attempt to show a whole new kind of feeling is possible within
Unreal Tournament.

The unusual colors are all within Unreal Tournament, no new textures were created! Instead
I made the point of using graphics nobody ever uses to build levels with, and painted them 
in many ways to acheive the pastel and primary look of the station.

I hope that you will find this level great fun, and that it will succeed in feeling just
like a cheesy 60's space movie!

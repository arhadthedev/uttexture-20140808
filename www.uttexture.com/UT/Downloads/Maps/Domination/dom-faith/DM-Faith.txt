Description: Deathmatch level based on altars, cathedral spaces,
and gothic architecture. Can be played as a Domination map by
copying the file "DM-Faith.unr" in the Maps directory, and
renaming the duplicate "DOM-Faith.unr".
Where to get this release: http://www.anvil-studio.com

Special Features:
Many of the 'floating' altars and platforms are actually connected
via invisible walkways. Look for architectural cues to see where
you can safely walk, or shoot first to reveal the solid pathways.
Of course, if you guess wrong or make a misstep, you will suffer
a fatal crisis of Faith!

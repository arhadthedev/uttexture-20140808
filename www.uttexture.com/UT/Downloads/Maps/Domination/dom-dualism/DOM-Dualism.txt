Description:

The world's elite once used Dualism as a galaxy viewing station, but to 
everyone's misfortune it became a popular spot for jumpers during the stock 
crash of 2102 and was closed soon after. After a recent auction, it has become 
the property of Mr. Slippery Enterprises and is now exploited as a Domination Arena.

DOM-Repentance for UT

Credit Hell Episodes I & II for Bungie's Marathon Infinity. 
It got an honorable mention in their map making contest.

Thanks to:

Epic Megagames for the game. Specifically the beta testers; UTCity, Jerkboy, 
Moron, Freaky, BTex, and [LaW]WhiteRaven.

Author's Note:

This is my first UT map. After many failed concepts and levels, I've finally finished one.
I tried to make a level I'd like to play AND would keep a decent frame rate.

The zapper works and the bots do use it. You can also shoot the power source
to set it off, but it only works with the plasma gun primary. I tried to make
the bots as sneaky as players.

Request:

Please select 5 things you don't like about the level and a few things you do.

Thank you for your support !!

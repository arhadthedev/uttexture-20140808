----This is version 1.1 with better lighting and with its name slightly altered so it would not conflict with a death match level.---

This level, my second, was built in 2 day.  It is a small domination map for about 6-9 players. If you play you should probably have translocator turned on to get some of the stuff.  Finally, good luck finding the sheild belt and the sniper sniper rifle.

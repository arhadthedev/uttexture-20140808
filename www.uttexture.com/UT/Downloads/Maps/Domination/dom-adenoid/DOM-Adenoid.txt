Story
	
	In 2146 the government set up the Adenoid Research Facility at a top secret location. 
It was set up to study alien materials and unknown objects beyond human understanding, using 
an advanced new device, no one knows where the government got it form, but wherever it was,
no man built it. A select group of scientists had their memorys wipped and were made to work 
there for the rest of their lives, which wasn't going to be very long. They found out that this 
device they had been given was poisoning them and slowly killing the planet. They swore never 
to use it again and to bury it, they murdered everyone who new about its location and then took 
their own lives, they beleived for the good of mankind. 

And so the Adenoid Research Facility was lost for nearly a three hundred years, until one day 
it was found by some miners, who didn't understand it's power. The mines handed it over to their 
parent company and bosses, The Liandri Corporation.


Author comments

	This is a Smallish Domination level that used to be a Deathmatch level, but i actually prefer 
this Domination variety to the Deathmatch, and it does make a nice domination level. Each Control Point 
has a lot of ways into it, and is very hard to defend which produces more oportunitys to sneak up on 
people from behind, more fast paced exchanging of control points and hopefully less camping by points.

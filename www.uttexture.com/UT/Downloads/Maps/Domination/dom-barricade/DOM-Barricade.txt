Author's Notes
--------------
Many DM maps can be converted to Domination with just a few tweaks.  
I chose to convert DM-Barricade because the soaring towers are a 
dream for the translocator and should be lots of fun for Domination 
players who love mobility.  DOM-Barricade really shines as a Domination map 
because the translocator is enabled by default, and you can just fly 
from parapet to parapet.  Also, the Control Points give the map focus: DM-Barricade
is a very large map, and the Control Points really pull the map together.
The map is large, but the fighting spaces are tight, so you always seem 
to be duking it out at close quarters.  Beware of ghosts: the castle is 
haunted with two invisibility power-ups!

The Control Points cater to three different playing styles: 

- The Control Point in the "Cellar" room is fairly defensible, and players who 
like to sit and defend will enjoy guarding this point.  Nevertheless, it is not
a slow paced Point, since there are many respawns nearby, so enemies keep 
arriving.  Your best bet on defense is to grab the ASMD and stay loaded with 
the shock cores up above.

- The Control Point on top of the "Tower" is for players who have mastered 
precise mobility; they will enjoy the thrill of translocating from tower 
to tower, duking it out with their enemies high above the ground.  Grab the 
ripper at the base of the tower and you can bounce your enemies off the 
tower using alt-fire.  If you have mastered the art of the "double-translocation," 
you can get from the ground (courtyard) up to the top of the tower with this 
move.  It comes in very handy on this map: shoot the translocator up, and 
when it is at its peak, hit "jump" and immediately translocate to it and 
shoot the translocator again over the tower and translocate to it again.  
Good luck.

- The Control Point at the "Courtyard" is the main focus of contention.  
This Control Point switches hands the most, and players who like fast 
paced action will enjoy fighting around this Control Point.  It is like 
a small rocket arena.  Grab the ASMD on the castle wall and hide in 
the shadows to combo anyone who comes near.

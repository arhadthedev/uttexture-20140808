Description             : A fairly simple outdoor domination level.  I'd recommend you play 			  with the translocator.  This version has a couple of things fixed 			  that I hadn't noticed at first, mostly to do with bots.

Max Polys               : About 160, but only in one place I think.  Mostly they're OK.
Known Issues/Bugs       : Bots use the translocator more than they did, but it still 			  doesn't happen that often.
			  There's a small hole in the cliff with the round cave.  I only 			  noticed it after I'd finished building the level, but it won't 			  detract from the gameplay.
			  When looked at from above, the catwalks surrounding the round 			  platform look a bit like a swastika.  This was an accident, and 			  does NOT indicate Nazi sympathies on my part.
			  Bots can't get to the sniper position above the waterfall, but 			  that's ok I think, as I can't get there myself most of the time.

Description             : The Millenial warehouse was once the a site of the liandri's short
                          lived Nali slave trade. Where irreputable coporation purchased
                          Nali for their obvious advantage in the manual labor force. When
                          the slave trade was ended the warehouse sat empty for years. 
                          A Liandri executive saw it's potential as a tournament arena
                          and converted it. It's status as a tournament arena  remains
                          in a state of protest by the Nali people.

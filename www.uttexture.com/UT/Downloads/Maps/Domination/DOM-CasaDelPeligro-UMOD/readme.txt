Information
-----------
This map is just of a house that I saw and wanted to make into a map. I've found
that in quite a few house-based maps, furniture tends to get in the way of game
flow. Sure, it looks nice, but you still want to have fun playing the map, right?
So, I decided I didn't want to put any furniture in this map, and in the spirit
of keeping it real, the idea is that the family who owns this house is just
moving in.

Bots tend not to go upstairs in the house. This isn't really a big deal since all
that is up there is a Health Pack.

Wondering why there's only one Domination checkpoint? That's because this map
is TINY. One is all that was necessary, and encourages bloodthirsty battles for
it!

Installation
------------
Unzip the file DOM-CasaDelPeligro.zip, and run the .umod file. Or if you have
downloaded the non-umod version, then just extract the .unr file into your
<utdir>\Maps folder, and the .utx file into your <utdir>\Textures folder.

Copyright/Permission
--------------------
Do whatever you like with the maps, just if you're going to release something
based off of this map, be sure to put my name in there somewhere, and let
me know about it. :) Also, anyone who wants to use one of the 2 custom textures
I made for this map is quite welcome. Those textures are "Doors.GarageDoor" and
"Misc.pGate".

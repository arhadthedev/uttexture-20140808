Ain't much here, but check it out anyway....just some strange place in a different galaxy, called Inferno. It's just a few rooms long, but the lava in one room and fiery-looking sky should call it Inferno for you.
3 control points here - the furnace (where the lava is), the 'death fall' (small outdoor area with an exceptionally long drop) and the courtyard - another small outdoor area in the back. All in all, check it out.

If there are changes you wanna make to this here map, it's a good idea to email me for permission first! 

Here are your basic directions (if you're having trouble, something's wrong with you):

Extract DOM-Inferno][.unr into the maps directory in your C:\UnrealTournament folder.
And that's all it is. Don't bother installing this readme.

Other maps by me, soon to be released:
DM-StripMine

Maps in progress:
DM-1on1-Turbulence

....and a bunch of others I've either yet to work on, or haven't thought of uploading to Nali City.

Have fun and frag well!!
:)

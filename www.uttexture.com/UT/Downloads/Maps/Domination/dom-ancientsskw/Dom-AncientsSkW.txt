Dom-AncientsSkW, Domination level for Unreal Tournament
_______________________________________________________

New UT DOM level by [SkW]Deathwish of the SKAARJWARRIORS (http://surf.to/skaarjwarriors | http://surf.to/scragsite).

Temple of Ancients is an Egyptian-themed UT Domination map. Symmetrical in design, there are rooms, waterways and corridors linking the three control points. Quite a simple map but plenty of space to move in!

The map comfortably accommodates between 4 and 8 players (12 player starts are provided). Framerate is fine because of the simple layout and zoning. The looks of the map are very cool - although the layout didn't work out as well as I had planned :-( . It's more DOM to play though!

Bots play fine. They translocate where they should and guard taken control points. There is a baffling tendency of some bots to run on the spot after taking the Pillar control point but they don't have a chance to stay there for long! There are few other bugs. No noticeable HOM.

Don't forget to download the other SkW maps...

Have fun and give me your feedback!

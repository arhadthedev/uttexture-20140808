This map is big and complex, it will push your system to its max. I worked hard to make sure there were no places in the map that gave me less then a FPS of 20 (in game play), and I have a old voodoo2 and k6-475 cpu, so anyting newer then that should kick ass.  I also tested this map on a old p200mmx, in software mode and as long as you dont look UP at the extra complex geomitry, in 2 areas of the map, its perfectly playable at a top FPS of 23! hehe, low FPS of 8 (if your used to that type of chalange..) 
IF you think the geomitry is complex now, you should have seen the HIGH POLY version , before I started triming the fat down for playability. Some of the extra fancy eye candy was cut, but its still stunningly beautiful, and viciously deadly.

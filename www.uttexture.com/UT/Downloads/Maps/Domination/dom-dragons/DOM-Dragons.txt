Description             : Opposing Dragons CPs surround the Beast's Belly Center CP.  Hallways Chamber mix with platforms, 
                          walkways, 2 lifts, shield, armor, keg and sufficient ammo and health.  Bot support for offline 
                          play is very good and it makes a fierce 5v and a strategic 3v in UT Domination.

* Other Info *

   -3rd published map by Saevus
   -Can be considered "DM-GreyFortress]["
   -The unoficial UT OpenGL driver is recomended.  It can be found here:
    http://cwdohnal.home.mindspring.com/utglr/
    Without the new OpenGL driver, this map may look dark and desaturated.  Other renders are old anyway, and should be 
    upgraded. ;-)
   -This map requires a faster PC.  Not-so-modern computers may lag!
   -There is a new hidden item: t3h AntiShockwave/Impact Suit.  It protects you against the impact hammer and Shockwave 
    damage from the Redeemer.


* FE (Fixed Edition) Changes *

Changes to Bot paths:
-Added, removed, and tweaked many pathnodes
-Deleted all the old kickers and replaced them with the SwJumpPad actor.  Visit here for more information on this 
 AWESOME new actor!  http://www.sabbathcat.co.uk/w00t/tutorial.htm
-Added lots of lift exits and lift centers to make bots jump off more ledges.
-Added a few jumpspots and fixed a few others.
-Bots will now go to nearly every secret.  There are only a few med kits the bots don't get, but for good reason.  
 The bots would end up having to impact jump to get them, which makes no sense, so I didn't do it.
-Added Bot-only kickers to keep them from getting stuck in a few places.

Changes to Gameplay:
-A second Rocket launcher has been added in an area that was slightly void of weapons before.  I felt the map needed a second rocket 
 launcher on the opposite end of the first rocket launcher.
-More PlayerStarts were added in quiet areas of the map to liven things up a little.  I felt that most of the action 
 occurred in only a few rooms before.
-The mover with the star appearance next to the shield belt moves faster now.  This was changed, because bots would 
 get distracted by other bots and jump into the dark matter before.
-A few health vials were removed.
-In order to get bots to use the super secret with the impact armor, some fake armor has been added on teleporter 
 to "trick" them into going up there.  Humans can grab the fake armor too, but they won't know they are getting it.  
 The armor is invisible in the game, and has no pickup sound.  This was the only possible way to make bots grab the secret
 with the impact armor and Redeemer!
-The "MaxDesireability" number has been increased on several items to make bots more interested in them.  This was done to 
 make quiet areas more active.
-The Dark Matter pits now inflict damager per second as well as vacuum you to death.  This was changed, because the player
 was able to swim to the surface and avoid death before.
-An impact jump is now required to reach the super secret.  Good luck. ;-)
-Most Teleporter Actors have been changed to the YawTeleporter, found here:
http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/YawTeleporter
This allows the player to always face a certain direction upon exiting the telporter destination.

Description             : Remake of Herrschen.  Changes include better bot support, brush alignment, texture changes
                          added brushes for better structural architecture as well as floor cover.  Changed CP bases for 
                          easier communication.  Dramatically increased lighting in the Upper Garret area and corrected 
                          lighting issues specified in Unreal Playground review.  Thanks to all who offered feedback.

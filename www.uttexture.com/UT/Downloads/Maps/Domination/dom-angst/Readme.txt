LAYOUT:

This tournament map used to be a fueling station for long-distance space flights. Then, Shell built a bigger, better fueling station, with a Coffee Shop! So the station lost it's coustomers to the new shell, and in came Liandri. They stripped the pumps, and added the rocket launchers.

INFO:

DOM-ANGST is the original, with a ROCKET LAUNCHER, FLAK CANNON, MINIGUN, PULSE GUN, BIO RIFLE and RIPPER.

DOM-(SN)ANGST is the same map, but with only sniper rifles!!!

INTALATION:

This map has no coustom Textures/ Sound FX. Just put the 2 .UNR files in the MAPS folder in C:/Unreal Tournament.

ENJOY!!!

A cool looking map, in my opinion. My brother's favorite so far. It didn't take a lot of work - so I bet I won't get such a great review.
Anyway, there are two outside courtyards, that are a little dark....well, they are dark alleys. THere are, instead of 3, 4 control points here. There are two tunnels as well, one with a control point. A few tall buildings in one courtyard.
It all adds up to a dark city scene....not a big map, but it's a city, all right, especially with the skybox. I kinda layered some mountains behind the city in the skybox. All in all, try this one out.

Now if you feel like you want to modify this map, email me for permission first! 

Here's the procedure:

Just extract DOM-Alleys.unr into the maps directory in your C:\UnrealTournament folder.
Then put a3text.utx in the textures directory in that same C:\UnrealTOurnament folder.
This readme is extra. Do whatever you want with it, I don't actually care.

Other maps by me, soon to be released:

DM-Upsidedown
DM-Purgatory
DM-Cellblock
DM-Stadium][ (joint project with brother, Jose A. Tobar, Jr.)
DOM-Inferno][

....and a bunch of others I've either yet to work on, or haven't thought of uploading to Nali City.

Happy Gaming, people!

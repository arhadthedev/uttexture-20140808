Hello,

Welcome to Keltok3

This UT-Map is my second UT-Project (after DM-Coaxis),
so don't expect too much!

DOM-Keltok3 has 4-ContolPoints, one of them is
under Water. 

I read some Pathnoding Tutorials but every said Bots
don't like to go under Water.

In this Map you're getting Bots fights under Water.
But sometimes this Map is too complex for Bots, or
my Pathnoding experience are too low, I'm sorry.

Try to find  three secrets!

It was a huge work to make this Map, but I learned
a lot.

And don't forget : There is no Spoon!

Bye

nexx (Robert Hoffmann)

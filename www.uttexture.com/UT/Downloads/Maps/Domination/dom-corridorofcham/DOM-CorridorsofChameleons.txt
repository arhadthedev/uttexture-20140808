Description : This map was an apocalypse when I opened it at UnrealED. There where so many places that I haven't saw while I was playing... I don't know why, but triggers didn't work at Unreal for me. So, in the DOM conversion that I did, I deleted them all, and simply opened the doors... Don't forget to get the powershield and the Megahealth at the upper levels, and of course, the Redeemer at the roof. Use the translocator in order to get there. So, 4 domination points, but a small and tight map... Have fun with this conversion!

Remember: The map is made by Phil Cole -willheaven-. I (topaz) simply made it Domination. He is the great mapper, not I. :) 


IF you like this conversion, I strongly suggest you to download the DOM-Pack that I have made, that includes some of the most interesting DOM-conversion that you can find over UT community. I also see many times that maps from this DOM-Pack, are played over the internet: DOM-GrooveMachine, DOM-Siberia and DOM-Ariza are the most popular. 

Dominate the Aztecs!
If you like the Aztec theme, then hold on: I am prepering a DOM-AztecPack with ten Domination maps that are gonna leave you sleepless! DOM-SunPyramid is included at the DOM-AztecPack, and so is DOM-Anka and DOM-CorridorofChameleons. For convinion reasons, the maps are gonna released seperatly and also together, as DOM-AztecPack.zip. You choose what method you like most.
Oh, the maps that DOM-AztecPack will include (so you can find the seperatly:):
DOM-SunPyramid
DOM-Anka
DOM-Aztec
DOM-CorridorofChameleons
DOM-AztecArena
DOM-Olden][
DOM-Tagar
DOM-Toooom
DOM-Torture

The maps are subject to change, according to their quality outcome.

Author's Notes
--------------
Ok, this is the last step from my DM-Hell_Fortress - terror: I converted the DM - Map into an Domination Map. And I must say:
it makes fun. It's VERY fast because the level is not very big. Feedback is welcome. And it would be very very very very very 
very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very 
nice if I would see a review at NaliCity.

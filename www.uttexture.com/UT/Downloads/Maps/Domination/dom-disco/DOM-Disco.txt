>>>Author's Notes<<<
this is a public apology for the crap previous version of this and dm-disco
due to an oversight on my part i included textures not found in unreal..
then screwed the texture file..this version works fine for all and has no probs
so slap me round the head and call me stupid please...if you downloaded the first

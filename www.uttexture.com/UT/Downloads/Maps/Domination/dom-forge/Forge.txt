Game Type :  Domination, Deathmatch and Team deathmatch.
	     There is a DM version and a DOM version of this map, which
             is a tweaked and slightly revised update of the original
             DM-Forge I made for Unreal 1.  
             
Description :  Deathmatch or Domination action in a moodily lit indoor
               setting with great flow and connectivity.  Plenty of
               multiple floor levels (walkways and ramps) add to the
               fun, but watch out for all that lava !  A note to anyone
               who has not played the original Unreal - the Asbestos
               suit I've placed in the map is lava-proof armour :-)
               
Ideal Loads :  This really comes into it's own as a fast paced DOM game
               with 3 teams fighting over the 3 evenly spaced control
               points. Be sure to check that your DOM score limit isn't 
               set at a wussy 100 points !
               Deathmatches are good for anywhere between 6 and 12 
               players.  Team DM play suits 5-7 players per team.

Shouts !       All my superb colleagues in the ShaMaN UT Clan. I must
               thank the Nali City reviewer who reviewed the Unreal 1 
               original DM Forge and gave it a 10/10 score :-)
               Also a shout to YOU for trying this map out - mail me 
               some feedback please !

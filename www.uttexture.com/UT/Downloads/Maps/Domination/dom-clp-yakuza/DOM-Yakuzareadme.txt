Extended Description
--------------------

After Boss Anjo of the Anjo Yakuza gang ran off woth a million yen the syndicate were forced to sell off their hideout to the tournaments to regain all their lost money.  
They were very bitter about this and are very likley to try and get their hideout back once they can afford it.  
Whether Liandri will want to sell it back is another matter... but the Yakuza aren't known for taking no for an answer.

Author's Notes
--------------

The theme of the map is an hideout for japans gangsters the Yakuza.  The Yakuza logo is just a decorative piece so you know its yakuza property not a clan tag just in case you were wondering.  
The textures are srtitcly speaking chinese but china/japanse style stuff is similar so it should be ok.  The map is for a lowppoly map pack so it itsn't the most detialed in the world but I'm hoping I made it a bit more interesting theme wise than most lowpoly maps. 
 By lowpoly its well under 200 polys per view.  The original limit was 105 then its was upped to 150 and then to 200 for some spots.  The most you will probably get is around 150 though so it should run very smoothly.  I would have added more decos but i couldn't find any yakuza themed ones.  I also couln't find any suitable japanese music so you got zan_b instead.  Anyway enjoy the map!

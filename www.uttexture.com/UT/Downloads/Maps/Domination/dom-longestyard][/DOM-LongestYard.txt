Installation	Simply extract the file DM-Longest Yard.unr into your 
		UT/maps directory, and the texture package (.utx) into
		your UT/texures folder.


Author Info	This is the update on my longest yard level, which is a conversion
		of one of the Quake III: Arena levels.  I decided to try and keep the
		architecture fairly similar to that of Q3, but make the 
		setting entirely different to give it that UT feel.

Bugs		The only bug i know of, is it may run a bit slow on some machines - still
		fun though!

Fixes		Basically, i took the whole thing apart, and put it back together again
		because some of the architecture was a bit screwed.

		The biggest bug was the fact that the map wasn't playable over the net,
		or network because of a texture package clash.  Also, the texture pack
		a3text is used in some other maps, and my version was different.
		To fix that, i just made a new texture package, so this should fix 
		both problems.

		Also, the bots can now get to the redeemer, and they shouldn't jump off the
		level any more.
		
		Fixed all the jumppad sounds, and you can't hear them from the sniper post.
		
		IF YOU FIND ANY OTHER BUGS, PLEASE CONTACT
		ME. ANY EMAIL WILL BE ANSWERED PROMPTLY.

Level Info	Currently, this level works with...

		Domination

		I have also made a dm version of this level 

Construction	I used the Unrealed beta version, and you don't want to know how long it took
		to create! 

The story		Not too far outside the earth's stratosphere, the original
		function of this space arena is not certain, however the Liandri Mining
		Corp. believe it to have been an abandoned space refuelling dock.  After 
		deeming it an ideal place for space deathmatch, LMC added in some
		of changed it to make it a fast and furious deathmatch arena.

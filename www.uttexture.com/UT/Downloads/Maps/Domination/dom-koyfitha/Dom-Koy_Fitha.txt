Description             : Domination map intended for those who might still believe

			  Editing Forum dwellers). This should make it clear why
			  I don't and never will.

Additional Credits to   : The neighbors letting me toss the dog poop in their yard :)

			  Everyone at Rust's Unreal forum, PlanetUnreal's Editing forum, and
			  Unrealized's Forum for giving me something to do in between 
			  brainfarts and mappers block.

			  Every RoadRunner Records band out there for giving me the inspiration
			  and raw stupidity to take the time to help out beginning mappers who
			  will hopefully make kick-ass maps, get jobs for it and provide me with
			  entertaining maps and games for years to come... wow that was a hell
			  of a run-on sentence :)

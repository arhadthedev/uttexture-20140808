* Other Info *

This map is set in a old indus. building.  There are 3 levels in the building.  The Roof top, the center of the
building, and a lower pool area.  I spent lots of time adding in detail to this map and getting the bots to work
properly.  The bots go everywhere and use all the lifts.  There are several ways to get to each level in this map.  
I put some paths outside the building that are kind of like the ones found in Peak.unr.  They lead from one level to
next and wrap around the building.  This map is very fun fast action.  I made it so that in order to get good items 
such as the redeemer, you have to travel a little ways away from the control points.  Have fun!

* How to install *

Put DOM-ColdBlueSkies.unr in your unrealtournament/maps directory
put Escape.umx in your unrealtournament/music directory
put Sky.utx in your unrealtournament/textures directory
put Space1.utx in your Unrealtournament/textures directory
launch the game and the new map will be in the map selection list.

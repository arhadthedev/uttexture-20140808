The Flight Deck of Alpha 4 is my second attempt at a map for Unreal 
Tournament. I wanted to try and place a control point on a mover that 
would leave the level for a while. I was not very succesful at the design 
and so here it is in its imcomplete glory. There are three zones that have 
control points in them. Each of these zones has at least three ways to get 
in so watch your back. I have added some movers for effect and there are 
one or two power-ups around so keep an eye out. Bots will come at you 
from almost every direction and they will use translocaters also. If you 
have feed back about my levels please let me know. My e-mail is at the 
bottom of the page. Have Fun!

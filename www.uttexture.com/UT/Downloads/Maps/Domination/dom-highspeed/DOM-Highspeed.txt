Author's Notes
--------------
Red_Dwarf:       This first came to me when I read a thread on the GT forum. Dufustle had converted Face into a 1 Control point
		 Domination map. Time went by and then the theme came up again, this time a guy called Major Disaster took up the 
		 idea and started a mod called Conquest. The game play was like the original King of the hill in Unreal. I basically
		 took the assault map and re did it to work better for the mod. Added more routes in added allot more brushes and this
                 is the outcome of it all.

Title                   : Akhenaten
Version                 : 1

Description             : Many of the maps released are so small that you 
                          cannot have the 20 to 30 player games you sometimes see
                          online.  Two large teams facing each other 
                          in this map would enjoy the typical domination
                          experience.  With smaller teams, it becomes a 
                          frenetic hunt.  It's recommended that you set the
                          number of points for victory to 200.  Hopefully
                          this map will meet the needs of the larger clans
                          in the Unreal Community.

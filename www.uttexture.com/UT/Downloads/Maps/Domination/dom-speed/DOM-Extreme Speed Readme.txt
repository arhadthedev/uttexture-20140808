Author's Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Story:
When Liandri where searching for new arenas to fight in they stumbled on
this abandoned arena in space. Liandri made it to a fast and easy frag
arena. Because of the speed and easy fragging they decided to name
it "EXTREME SPEED"

This map was created to flow very good and for easy and fast fragging!
The bots preform very well... i haven't seen any of them get stuck :-)

I hope you like it!

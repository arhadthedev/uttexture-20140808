--- Special Features ---
The giant Amazon statues were modelled in 3D Studio MAX and
imported into UnrealEd for texture mapping. This task could have
made much more straightforward if there were some way to
export brushes from MAX, while retaining the mapping coordinates.
Anyone wishing to collaborate on the creation of such a tool is
encouraged to contact the author.

--- Developer Notes ---
Level designers may use the Amazon statue brushes and textures included
in this release in their own work, with the following restrictions:
1. You may NOT use this content in a commercial product, contest or 
    competition without the author's permission.
2. You must credit the author in any text files, web pages, or other
    publicity which accompanies your product.
3. I would like to see what you're doing with it. Please send me URLs 
    to where I can see your work.
Note that the statue brushes are very complex. simply placing the entire
statue in a big cube will result in very high node counts. It is recommended
that you break the statue up, use only part of it, or place other brushes
in such a way that only a portion of the whole is visible at one time.
Another version of the statue is available in a neutral pose, which may
make it easier to use. Contact the author for more information.

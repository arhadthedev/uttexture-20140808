Author's Notes
--------------
Many DM maps can be converted to Domination with just a few tweaks.  
I chose to convert DM-Conveyor because the tremendous catwalks are a 
dream for the translocator, and should be lots of fun for Domination 
players who love mobility.  DOM-Conveyor really shines as a Domination map 
because the translocator is enabled by default, and you can just fly 
among the catwalks.  Also, the Control Points give the map focus: DM-Conveyor
is a very large map, and in DM it may strike some players as simply 
sprawling, but with the Control Points in Domination it gains clear focal
points.  In particular, the Control Point at the "Catwalks" becomes the heart 
of the map and the center of battle.  Domination "pulls the map together."

The Control Points cater to three different playing styles: 

- The Control Point in the "Pipes" room is fairly defensible, and players who 
like to sit and defend will enjoy guarding this point.  It is a slow paced
Point, and players who like a slower pace will enjoy attacking and defending 
this point.

- The Control Point on the beam across the "Lava" vat is for players who 
have mastered precise mobility; they will enjoy the thrill of walking the 
tight rope above the deadly lava, and they can translocate with such 
precision that they can translocate exactly to this Control Point without 
falling into the molten vat.

- The Control Point at the"Catwalks" is the main focus of contention.  
This Control Point switches hands the most, and players who like fast 
paced action will enjoy fighting around this Control Point.  There are 
multiple access routes, so you never know where your attacker will come from 
next.  The best way to defend this Point is with a shock rifle, so you 
can combo anybody coming from the catwalk side.  However, you also need a 
buddy to watch your back, because there are two more entrace routes behind 
your shoulders.  Good luck!  Standing guard at this Point, waiting tensely, 
never knowing where your enemy will pop out from...somehow it reminds me of 
the movie Alien.  The whole map has a little Alien feel to it...a sprawling 
dark run down environment...you are often wandering alone...with enemies 
suddenly popping out to attack you...

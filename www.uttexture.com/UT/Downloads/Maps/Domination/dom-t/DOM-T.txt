Author's Notes          
--------------          An older style domination map for 6 - 12 players. The design requires that
you play with atleast the jumpboots \ but even better with the translocator and jumpboots.The reason:
There is only one access to the upper story (the left hand side stairs and playing without trans and
jumpboots might be a bit frustrating i.e., having to run all the way around to the stairs to get back
up to the upper section.) The bots behave really nicely in this map and I'm sure you will find them a 
challenge on your skill setting. Hope you enjoy the map. :)

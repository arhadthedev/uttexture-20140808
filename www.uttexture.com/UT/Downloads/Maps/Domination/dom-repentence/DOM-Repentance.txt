Description
------------
After the purchase of Dualism Viewing Station, Mr. Slippery Enterprises' corporate law firm discovered it had also gained ownership of this remote retreat in the snowny highlands. Not allowing any profit taking opportunity to remain unattended, it has converted it to another Domination Arena.

Thanks to
----------
Epic Megagames, UTCity, and the UTCity beta testers; -Mental -Citizensmith -Silencer -Jerkboy. Specifically Shane Caudle for the texture set and brushes that I used as guidance or outright copied (doors, stairway, and some arches). I sent an email to Shane asking permission and he replied with a yes (What a relief).

Author's Note
--------------
This is my second complete UT map. I've finally gotten comfortable with the editor and I hope it shows. There is only one secret area.

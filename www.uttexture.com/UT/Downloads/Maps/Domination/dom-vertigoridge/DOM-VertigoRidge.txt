Extended description
--------------------
The search for exotic settings for Tournament matches is viciously 
competitive. Construction crews will go anywhere and to any lengths 
in order to have possession of arenas to sell to Liandri.

VextArc Inc. is no different. And their latest exploit is a fine 
example. Construction crews and Tournament Engineers braved brutal 
and dangerous Na Pali for a one of a kind setting. Na Pali sports 
a mid-continental ridge that puts Earth's Midatlantic Ridge to shame. 
And this one isn't under water.

Vertigo Ridge is set deep into the ridge far from the probing rays 
of the sun, and far from view of the ridge's hot floor. Watch your 
step, because it's a long way down.


Author's Notes
--------------
I have not discovered any bugs in this map. I hope you don't either.

Bots are fully implemented, including strategic pathing for 
translocator jumps and specially chosen defence points.

This map really doesn't work well with more than ten players. Enough 
so that I have only included 10 spawn points (really, there just isn't
room for more spawn points). So play with a higher player count at
your own risk.

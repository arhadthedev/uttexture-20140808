Map Name: DOM-Contained
Programs Used: UED 2.0 and the human brain (no, its not a program)
Time Taken: 2 weeks
Comment: This is a very cool map, has a working conveyor belt, only one
elevator, lots of highly detailed areas, and the nice looking broken
glass. This map is a test facility on different species of aliens 
created by the Liandri Coproration shortly after the founding of 
deathmatch, it was here that Xan was created, and where most of the
Tournament weapons were manufactured until a break out of a certain
Species #6574-A Class Humanoid. After the loss of a truly magnificent
specimen all of the scientists and technichians were executed to make
sure that this information did not spread into the media. Liandri 
however decided to make this test facility a battleground for the most
skilled warriors.

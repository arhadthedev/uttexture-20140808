and are available on my site also.The map names have not been changed. Certain things needed to be addressed and so I dutifully updated them and thought it would be right to inform you as one site in particular didn't update them because I had not changed the map names to include a new version number;Of which I was only recently aware.But now I know*)

Author's Notes          
--------------         A Domination Map inspired by the ancient texture set. The objective was to make a nice size map for 14 players that wouldn't chug too much on my old p2 300 Voodoo2 - but would still be relatively nice to look at. Some special effects were purposefully left out for the sake of fps on similair 'mid' spec systems; in an attempt to balance the 'play' and 'eyecandy'. Lighting was a bitch on this one...! :0 *A DeathMatch Verison is also available as a seperate download on my page;I like to tweak certain pathnodes and things for bots to suit the two different gametypes; rather than just rename the 'DOM' version to a 'DM'. Anyways, I hope You Enjoy DOM-Diva. :)  Feedback always welcome.

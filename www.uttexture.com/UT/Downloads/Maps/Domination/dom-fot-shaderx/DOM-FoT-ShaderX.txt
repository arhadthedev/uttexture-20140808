Description             : Its a map i made half a year ago , was originally made for the second LowPoly pack , but i felt tired to see it waiting on my Hd without
                          sharing it with people , so here we go , I profit of the FOT pack to make it a Domination map . Honestly , I think the 
				layout serves very well for that purpose.
                          for this gametype , hope you will like it . dedicated to all Megaman Fans , and i know there are a lot ;) ,enjoy :)

--- Story ---

It has been years since the Reploid armada under the lead of the MaverickHunters Megaman X and Zero finally wiped out the threat of Sigma, the most evil
villain humankind had ever met until that point. He was created through some virus infection and was then able to spread every computer system with this 
virus forcing normal Reploids to go berserk. The former thinking robots turned into cruel warmachines.
However, the Reploid Wars came to an end a mere hundred years after they had been started by Sigma himself. ShaderX is a rebuilt station of one part 
of Sigma's moon station, where the last battle had been fought long ago. They intended the place to be a flying fortress, however, and so it's flying 
over the endless oceans. With this fortress Liandri is providing a rebuilt of the last clash between the forces of Good and Evil.

The Story So Far:
----------------
After the Human-Skarji wars, Liandri accquired a Skarji mine built into an asteroid. 
This asteroid was brought into an Earth orbit and was given gravity similar to that of Earths, 
along with a decent atmosphere. It is now used as a domination tournament arena.

The Control Points:
-------------------
Crane room:	This is in a corner of the room where trains are loaded/unloaded by cranes.
Storage:	This is in the main store room, with all the large metal crates.
Control:	This is in the mines control room, which houses most of the mines system 
		controls and display panels etc.
Landing Pad:	This is in the centre of the landing pad where spaceships land and take off from.
		It is built into a natural crater on the asteroid and can be seen from a window
		in the control room.

Secrets:
--------
One, gives player damage amplifier. Unknown to bots.

How to play:
------------
Copy file "DOM-AstroMine.unr" to your unrealtournament/maps directory and then the map should
appear on the domination map list of the "Start Practice Session" window.

Known Problems:
---------------
I don't think there are any, but I am having problems with my graphics card at the moment so the
lighting is probably all wrong and I just don't know about it.

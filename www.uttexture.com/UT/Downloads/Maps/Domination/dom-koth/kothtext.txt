Author notes
------------
This map is a product of my fiddlings with terra edit . It began as practice terrain , but evolved into Dom_Koth . The map has high poly counts ( 300+) from viewing from some spots , so slower pc's may experience slowdown . My P266 voodoo 3000 128ram pc handles it ok . I understand the debate on high poly counts , and I think I could achieve a similar result with less , but I am really not concerned this time , and as I say , it does run ok on my system . My apologies if you download this map , and are unable to play it . During tests , players made no mention of major slowdown . 
 Also of note , is that unlike some Dom games , there is 1 control point in Dom_Koth . This is a way I think , to achieve a King of the Hill type game . 
 Also , also of note , is that you can play Dom_Koth , as a Dm game , by changing the name to Dm_Koth , and then selecting it from the Dm menu in UT . Though , it was completed with Dom in mind .

Thanks to Static , Paul , Dia shan , garF , Shade , browndog , TaroT , RedRaven , Atticbat , and anyone else who helped with testing , and providing input .

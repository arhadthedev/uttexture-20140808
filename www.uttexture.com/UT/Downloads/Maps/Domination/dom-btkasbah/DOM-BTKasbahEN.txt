Description             : Map built with Unreal editor (UT). 
                          Starting from a picture of a south Morocco Kasbah, I
                          built that map and put 3 control points to play
                          domination system of UT : one control point on the 
                          last floor (TOP), 1 CT on the second floor (MIDDLE),
                          and he last one on the first floor (LOWER). 
                            
Others UT Maps          : DM-BTDAIKATAN-UT (like "storm sector 7" of Daikatana
                                            demo)
                          CTF-BTGoldenKrall (capture the flag) for UT.

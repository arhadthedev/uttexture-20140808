Converter's Note
----------------
As I could not find out about Nivlek's eMail address, I decided
to simply release this map without asking for his permission. If
anyone knows more about him than I was able to find out, please
eMail me. (luggage@nedasfreedomfighters.com)

I think I should do something about the weapon placement, it
doesn't somehow feel right yet.


Coming up...
------------------
A Space-themed CTF map: CTF-ZeroG... (If I get it done this time...)

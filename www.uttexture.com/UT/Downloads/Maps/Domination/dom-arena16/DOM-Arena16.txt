Extended description:
--------------------
This is the first Domination Temple built by Liandri.  Since it is the easiest to follow architecturally, it is the favorite of beginner and advanced tournament players alike.  The ultimate in balance, this design was later phased out in favor of more gruesome, misbalanced Domination levels.

There is a rumour that Liandri also built a Deathmatch temple with these same blueprints.

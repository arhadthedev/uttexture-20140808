Hold The Fort

by Adam Lohr



How to Install:

	Simply unzip these files, then place DOM-HoldTheFort.unr in your maps directory, and put HoldTheFort.umx in your music directory. 



How to Play: 

	Hold the Fort is basically a king of the hill game using a single control point which is contained in the fort. One team defends the control point while the others try and invade.



Ideal Playing Conditions:

	Translocators off, weapons stay off, and 16 human players.



Recommended Mutators:

	For this map, I don't recommend using any mutators as they mostly offset balance of the map. The better weapons and supplies are all outside the fort for a reason. Of course, I wouldn't object to anyone who wanted to try any mutators... fatboy couldn't hurt any.


About this Map:

	Probably the most significant thing about this map (to me) is the music, which I created myself (using ModPlug Tracker (www.modplug.com), a wonderful program). Although it really isn't all that great, I just wanted to include some original music. I hope it's not too irritating for anyone.
	The whole concept behind this map was to add an extra element of strategy to the game, and to make teamwork much more productive. My favorite multiplayer game to date (keep in mind, I have a very bad connection) is Delta Force, and I got the idea for this from the team king of the hill snow map which is my favorite.

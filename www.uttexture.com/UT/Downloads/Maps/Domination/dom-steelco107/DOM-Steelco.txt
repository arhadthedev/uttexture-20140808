Installation
------------
Put it in your unrealtournament/maps directory
citytex.utx goes in unrealtournament/textures

I was using textures in citytex.utx in early builds of the map, after I realized this wasn't
one of the textures packages included with the game, I took out the textures, but for some
reason, UT keeps look for the unused textures!?!?!  I know its not used because I put the
texture on a wall and right-clicked and selected matching textures, no other textures were
highlighted.  I have no idea what happened.

Extended description: A simple domination map in a city atmosphere.  Flickering street lights,
a nice garden, and howling winds.

Author's Notes
--------------
I'm just a 14 year old first time UT author.  I play UT, Q3A, Tribes, and Hexenworld (for Hexen II).
Feedback on this map is welcome, I need to learn as much as I can.  I read as many tutorials
as a could to keep this from being your typical lousy, slipshod newbie map.  Not much else to say.

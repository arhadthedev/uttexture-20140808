Description : In this level all of the players have been shrunk to 1/13th their original 
              size and transported to a room within a secret location. The match location 
              has been fitted with special jump-pads to help the players capture the control
              points which are located higher than normal.
              

Special Features : Players are 1/13th their normal size. 
                   (Actually everything in the map is 13 times normal size)
                   Also, there is a little joke in the garbage can.

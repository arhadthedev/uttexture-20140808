"author notes"-pleez email me with comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This is my first domination map, but also play it reg. dm, and this is a conversion from an earlier map i made for unreal let me say something, some ppl complain and say, 
oh, that map isnt as "pretty" as that map, etc. etc. , and i will be the first to admit, i dont
have the prettiest maps, but there is a reason to this.  most of my maps are done shortly, concentrating
on the gameplay.  that is what makes a good map, is gameplay, not how pretty it is, granted, that is 
an added plus,but it shouldnt be the main factor in this type of game. i would love to hear what you ppl
have to say about my maps, but try to concentrate, on gameplay, that will help me the most=]

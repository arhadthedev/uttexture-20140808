Author's Notes
--------------
Wasn't ever going to do a DOM map, but what the heck, I don't need to sleep.
The name was inspired by the Intro music for UT, the content by a few fun ideas.
Version 1.0: Made for the "Make something Unreal Contest, made the top 15, and
even CliffyB had to play it as part of the final judging.
Version 2.0: General release to Nali-City after minor zone tweaking.
Now in version 3.0: increased connectivity by adding the drain pipe and Iceway.
Cut the polys and increased the FPS. More Bot AI and weapons (Redeemer).
***This map was made for internet/LAN play***

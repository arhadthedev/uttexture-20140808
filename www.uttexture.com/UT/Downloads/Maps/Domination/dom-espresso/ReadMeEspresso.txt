---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

--- Play Information ==================================================================

Game                    : UTv436
Level Name              : DOM-Espresso
New Sounds              : No
New Static Meshes	: No
New Textures            : Yes; Rock178-256 modified from the Absolute Background Textures Archive at                                                   http://www.grsites.com/textures/
			  c_WALL2A2 modified from Crypt2 textures provided by Epic.	  
New Graphics            : No
New Music		: No; thought about adding new music, but Lock.umx seems to tie into the map too well to replace.

Known bugs: A few BSP flickers that should not be visible during normal gameplay; Please e-mail me with suggestions or corrections.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Suggested use - Naturally you can play it the way you want, but I enjoy it most this way:
-Weapons do not stay; uncheck that box.
-Mutators: Instant Rockets and Volatile Ammo. Relics: strength/speed/regen, Chainsaw Melee. No Low Grav or Jump Match.
-Rules: Score to 200; 3 teams with 4 players on each team.
-Bots: Play at Godlike with enhanced team AI. You get killed a lot, but so does everyone else and it's really fast.

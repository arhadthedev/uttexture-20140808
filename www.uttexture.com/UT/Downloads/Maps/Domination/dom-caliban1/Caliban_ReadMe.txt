Description : The Caliban Arena, for best result you turn off ut sound and listen to Caliban (Shadow Hearts) and play :) well if not it is cool too .  The map is set in some kind of manufactory on a planet far away called Horst 666 ;) Mainly inspired by listening to caliban's music ! Buy it its good !
As there are far to less dom maps around I converted my DM map Caliban to DOM. I used the enhancedDOM with DomLights by Sabbath Cat.         :

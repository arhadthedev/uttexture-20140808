Description             	: Original Domination map.
		An old mineshaft that was engulfed in the early Tournaments then left to rot. 
		Three levels of control makes for a total frag-fest. Most of the weapons and 
		armour are at the top, in an "outside" area. Watch that you don't fall into the 
		slime. The elevator/lifts need some tweaking but all in all, for my 2nd map, 
		I think this one ROCKS!!

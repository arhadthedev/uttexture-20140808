This is my first level which I created in just under a week and maybe you can tell ;). In my play testing i learned what a pain bots are and they still manage to make the stupid mistake now and again... but don't we all.  I have played this map until it sickens me, and now, it's your turn.  It is most suitable for 8 players with however many teams.

To the reviewes... BE NICE!!!   ¤,¤

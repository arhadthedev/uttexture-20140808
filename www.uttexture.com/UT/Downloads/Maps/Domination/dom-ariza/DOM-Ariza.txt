Description : Some maps that you could play back at the old days with Unreal, are simply
too good to be forgotten. There is a way to remake them, for UT. Change the textures, put 
some Domination Points, add Bot Teamplay and you can have really great fun with them. The story
will continue, since I have already some Domination conversions for the Greatest Maps that 
we all saw and played to death with Unreal. 
Remember: The map is made by Myscha the Sled dog. I (topaz) simply made it Domination. He is 
the great mapper, not I. :)

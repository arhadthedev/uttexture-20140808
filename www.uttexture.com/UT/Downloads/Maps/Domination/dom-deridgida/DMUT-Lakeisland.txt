Shortly after her transformation into a barely controllable, psychotic, fire mage, Rettica travelled back to her childhood home on Deridgida lakes' island and burned it down in a still life-long crazed state of mind. Her malicious family fled out of the house and onto a boat, barely recognising who it was in the distance screaming like a posessed harpie as flames swirled around her body and swept the grassy ground. Her parents, the Dekartens had fled this deliberate event and hid in exile in a far off city, keeping their heads down and their family name a secret, so as their daughter may never track them down again.
Years later, all that was left of their home were the foundations and a strange artefact.

After Rettica had visited the island, it was left entirely to itself for the first time in centuries. All the rich families, tribes and religious cults had disappeared and no-one was left to look after it. Although the whole island, and even the Deridgida area had never been very natural in the first place, all the centuries of god, demon and magic worship had filled the island with an even eerier 'unaturalness'. Even in the middle of summer at midday its never light over the island, a constant murky cloud hangs over the lake, cutting it off from the light outside and the fires that light up the island still burn....

Now, people say the island looks after itself.

Installation

   Unzip the the files.  Place them into your  directories under the unreal
   directory: the .unr file goes into the MAPS folder, and the .uax file goes
   into the SOUNDS folder.

Author's Notes
--------------
Not much new to say in this level, since I built this upon a previous Unreal DM level of
mine.

GIVE ME FEEDBACK!  I want to know what people like, what they don't like, how it runs,
weapon placement, suggestions, etc.  I really do listen and adapt levels to what people
like!

Changes
-------

Changes from the Deathmatch version:
1.  Changed all of the weapons and their placement.
2.  Added free access to third level via teleporters.
3.  Added UT improvements for the bots, such as translocator nodes.  And control points,
of course.

Author's Notes
--------------
The Buddhas were a hard working people.  They spent MANY long,
tedious years chiseling out their sacred temple from the
mountains, using nothing but measely rock hammers.  Alas, all
of the time and effort the Buddhas invested in this spiritual shrine
was spent in vain.  Not more than a month after the temple was
errected, the Liandri Corporation came and stole it from them, using
an extreme type of violence the Buddhas did not condone.

The Buddhas now pray, nobody knows where.  They pray for the
forgiveness of the tormented souls who massacred the Buddhas and
stole the temple.  The purity of mind that the Buddhas possess
allows them to see past the wretchedness that most humans cannot.
As you battle in their temple and upon sacred ground, remember
the innocent Buddhas that were slain so that you may fight in
these mountains.


Copyright / Permissions
-----------------------
This level is not copywrited.  Most of the user made maps, if not
all of them, are also not copywrited.  Map authors use this
section of their readmes to intimidate people and encourage them
not to steal/reuse/take-credit-for their maps or any parts of them
because they would not like you to do that.

Although I do not want you to use my level or parts of it for
use in/as your own level, I cannot stop you from doing it.
You would not be breaking the law if you did.  You would
not be breaking the law (probably, I cannot guarantee) if you
used parts or levels made by other map authors.

Using someone else's work is not good without their permission.
If you don't give the original author credit, then not only is it
wrong, but it is also lying.  Howerver, pretending that a level is
copywrited is also lying.

Lying begets lying.

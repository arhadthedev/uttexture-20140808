Description:

  This map is larger than the other maps I've released.  Like my 
other maps, it has a butt-load of weapons.  This time, things aren't 
so fast and furious, so I including a sniper rifle :)  and a few 
good sniping points.  If you're crafty enough, you'll find them.  
  This map has only one control point.  It's at the top of the hill.

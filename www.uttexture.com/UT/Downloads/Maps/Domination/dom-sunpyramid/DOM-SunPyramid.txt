Title : DOM-SunPyramid

Release Date : 30-04-00
Filename : DOM-SunPyramid
Author(s) : Original map by Enrique and Jorge Salgado (Dominated by topaz)
Email Address : kbmindkeep@hotmail.com
Description : DMSunPyramid is an excellent example of Domination map. Set back in time, with an Aztec Theme, I am sure you are gonna have major fun playing this level. I added some things to the original map, but the full credit goes to Enrique and Jorge Salgado. 

Remember: The map is made Enrique and Jorge Salgado. I (topaz) simply made it Domination. They are the great mappers, not I. :) 


IF you like this conversion, I strongly suggest you to download the DOM-Pack that I have made, that includes some of the most interesting DOM-conversion that you can find over UT community. I also see many times that maps from this DOM-Pack, are played over the internet: DOM-GrooveMachine, DOM-Siberia and DOM-Ariza are the most popular. 

Dominate the Aztecs!
If you like the Aztec theme, then hold on: I am prepering a DOM-AztecPack with ten Domination maps that are gonna leave you sleepless! DOM-SunPyramid is included at the DOM-AztecPack, and so is DOM-Anka. For convinion reasons, the maps are gonna released seperatly and also together, as DOM-AztecPack.zip. You choose what method you like most.
Oh, the maps that DOM-AztecPack will include (so you can find the seperatly:):
DOM-SunPyramid
DOM-Anka
DOM-Aztec
DOM-CorridorsofChameleons
DOM-AztecArena
DOM-Olden][
DOM-Tagar
DOM-Toooom
DOM-Torture

The maps are subject to change, according to their quality outcome.

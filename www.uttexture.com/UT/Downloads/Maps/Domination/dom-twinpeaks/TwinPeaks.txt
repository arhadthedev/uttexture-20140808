Hints:  1.  You can dive into the pool of water from the bridge
        2.  You can get the scuba gear and then snipe from the pool
	3.  Use the translocator or impact hammer to get the redeemer, udamage and invis.
	4.  There are several ways of getting down from the bridge if you don't want to use the teleporter, you can drop a translocator in the canyon, or you can actually ski down the mountain, ala Tribes!

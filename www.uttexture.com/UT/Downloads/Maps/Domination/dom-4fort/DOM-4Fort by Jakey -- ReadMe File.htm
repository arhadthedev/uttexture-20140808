	    comment to map authors: 
	
	    This template has been optimized to use the graphics files in UnrealTournament/ngWorldStats.com/ngstats/html/graphics/ 
	    and should be stored in the UnrealTournament/Help/ directory. You may wish to indicate this by putting the edited readme 
	    inside a Help/ dir in your Zip file as a hint to the user. 
	
	    This template has been *visually* optimized to make manual editing as easy as cutting a slice of cake.
	
	    if you work with this file in a graphical editor instead of an HTML-based or TEXT-based editor,
	
	        _I am not responsible for the quality of the HTML that it produces._ 
	
	    This template, as it is, is as 
	
	    *CLEAN AND STREAMLINED AS HTML WILL EVER GET and FULLY 'HTML 4.0 TRANSITIONAL' COMPLIANT*
	        (which means that it will work with browsers that only support html 3.2, and even those that
	         don't have CSS1 stylesheet support, which is only used here as an enhancement for readability),
	
	    and you are STRONGLY advised to stay away from any graphical editors that monkey with its structure. If you must  
	    add to the template due to differences in your level creation, please attempt to duplicate the HTML as  
	    it is used, as closely as possible to avoid problems, and *lock the template file* to avoid overwriting it.
	
	    You have been duly warned.
	
	    You are also STRONGLY advised to name this file 'YourMapName.htm' instead of 'README.htm' so that it doesn't 
	    overwrite someone else's readme, and so that you can easily tell which map it belongs to when you accumulate a 
	    collection of them.
	
	    This Template generator also places an HTML comment for MAPSCAN to parse out the author name and e-mail easily.
	    I recommend using the template generator rather than editing this yourself, as you might overlook the comment otherwise.

      <H3 align=center>Extended Description </H3>
      <HR align=center width="70%" SIZE=5>
      <BR>
      <P>In the secluded mountains of Harbrhar 69, an ancient fort complex 
      composed of 4 different forts was used as a military training base... but 
      not anymore. Greedy Corporate bastard Liandri stole the land away by 
      hiring a hitman to take out the current title owner of this land. Liandri 
      made his own improvements to the site, including a mountain, tons of 
      sniper posts, underground tunnels which connect to each other... and of 
      corse our favorite lava pit! </P>
      <P><BR></P>
      <H3 align=center>Author's Notes </H3>
      <HR align=center width="70%" SIZE=5>
      <BR>
      <P>- Watch out, the top of the mountain is slippery, guard rails have been 
      placed but construction wasn't the greatest, nor completed. It can make 
      for a good sniper post however.<BR><BR>- Lava is hot... Not good.<BR><BR>- 
      Heh heh, you will never find the hidden health keg without cheating! (or 
      spying on someone who saw me open it)<BR><BR>- Redeemer good, napster bad! 
      er wait a minute... 
<BR><BR>- Game is best played with full bot/player load and a high point goal (ie 300 or so, i use 500). </P>

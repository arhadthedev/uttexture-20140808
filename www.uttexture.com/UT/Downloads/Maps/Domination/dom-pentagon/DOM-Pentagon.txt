Note by Author
--------------
I think it worked out pretty well,it's a nice kind of alien/ancient building with all kinds of different rooms, only the outside area is not for playing only for the redeemer,the bots shouldn't even go out.
I hope that it turned out good enough for all you players out there, and that you enjoy playing this level!

-=[ Notes ]=-

ATTENTION-- This is a THEME MAP! However, even if you hate theme maps, you may
like this. It takes place in and around a haunted house. There are 4 control points,
with many routes to each point. At least 1 of every item/weapon is in here,
with the exception of the super shock rifle and the scuba gear.
Look hard enough and you will find it all. Some of them require the translocator :)
This map was tested on several different machines, and if it looks/runs like crap on
your system, I apologize. A couple areas can get a bit demanding.

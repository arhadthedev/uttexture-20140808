Special thanks to DiaShan for comments , and letting me watch testing online with all beta versions . This helped improve the map a lot . 

There are no switches , or hidden items . 
Well...I lied . I hid 4 sets of jump boots . Perhaps they wont help the play much , but they are there if you want .

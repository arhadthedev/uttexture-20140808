This is my first attempt at maps...so be patient :)
the domination one is slightly different that the deathmatch but only sometically really.
they both play very fast,and since i kept the size down its good for ping to i found.
report anything to gumtrees@hotmail.com so i can fix any problems or add to it to make it bigger.
thanx for helping me test it

This is my new map based on the concept of King of the hill
one domination point
and no weapons on the upper lvls so its a race to grab the point and hold it for as long as possible
Iv,e tried my hardest to make this playable so any remarks feel free to flame me :)
have fun and good fraggin guys

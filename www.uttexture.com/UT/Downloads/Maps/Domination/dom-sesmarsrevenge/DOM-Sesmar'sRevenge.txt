History
-------
Upon his death, Sesmar's trap was set.  He would still have his Revenge!
After his untimely demise, his greatest enemies were hunted down and 
trapped in a small arena, forced to fight to the death.  Liandra Corp 
quickly bought the newly uncovered arena after it was found and 
renovated it for frenzied Domination combat.

Author's Notes
--------------
Ultron: I loved the original Unreal map and felt that it could be a good,
small Domination map.  I used the Epyptian theme because it fit the map.
This map is PURE DOMINATION.  It's all too easy to spend a few seconds 
fragging away, but while you're busy doing that, someone else is quickly 
adding to their score.  This map really shines with 8 people and four 
teams!

I'd also like to thank Red_Dwarf for his quick work with his finishing 
touches.  And many thanks to The Emperor for providing the perfect base 
for this map!

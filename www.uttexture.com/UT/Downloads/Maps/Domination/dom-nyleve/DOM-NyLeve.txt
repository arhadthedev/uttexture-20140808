Author's notes
--------------
I suggest you play this level with 32 players (2-4 teams - try with 4). 
In order to add more bots, load the console by pressing the '~' key, type IAMTHEONE, then
type ADDBOTS X. Where X the number of bots you wish to insert (for 32 players: select 15 bots,
then, during gameplay, try the console command with X = 16).

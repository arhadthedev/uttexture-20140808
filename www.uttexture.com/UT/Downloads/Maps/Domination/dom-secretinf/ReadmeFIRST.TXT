YOU MUST HAVE INFILTRATION TO PLAY THIS LEVEL!!!

Get it at http://www.planetunreal.com/infiltration/


The contents of Inf_M2_turret(1).zip are available in this archive, so you don't need to go get it.  The readme file is also included.

These are the files that come in the aforementioned zip file:

InfAdds.u
Warren1.utx
DM-INFShootingRange.unr
Readme.txt

If you have the M2.50cal already, then I suggest that you do not copy these files because they may be outdated at some point (a new version of Infiltration is coming out).  I'll keep an eye on it.

FASTER GAMEPLAY TIPS:

	I admit my level may be prone to bad frame rates in a few areas on machines less
than a P2 400, 128mb RAM.  I have found a few solutions that make play on my machine (the one i just mentioned) faster.  First of all, reduce the lifespan of dropped weapons and ammo (I don't play with dropped ammo).  Second, don't start with shotguns.  The bots love to use the flashlight
in this level even more so than usual.  15 bots with their flashlights on, makes the computer puke.  I pulled a 15000+ frame rate at one point and it never dropped below that.  Cool, eh?

Known bugs              : Bots get hung up around one of the .50 Cals on occasion. Usually
			  they smarten up.  A bug I have seen twice... and I'm not sure if
			  this is an Infiltration bug or something I'm doing wrong... is
			  the bots occasionally freeze up outside the base when they try to
			  use grenades.  They also get all freaky looking on their right sides.
			  Weird.
			  The .50 cals can be a bit difficult to fire at times due to placing
			  their triggers very close to them so that the bots weren't always
			  activating them when they ran down the hallways.

Description		:
The Intangible used to be the pleasure yacht of a space pirate
whose career ended with a firefight near Vandaron IV that left half
of the ship ruined.  The ship, which subsequently became government
property, would have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to
restore to a state that would meet even the minimum safety
requirements of spacefaring vessels.  The Liandri corporation,
whose tournaments are not required to meet such standards, picked
up the ship at a scrapyard price.  After its hull was patched up,
its engines repaired, and its life support systems restored to the
(mostly) undamaged portion of its interior, The Intangible was sent
into orbit around Earth, where Tournament contestants pound on its
increasingly charred insides as it lives out its final days.

Misc. Information	:
This is a fairly small level, designed for 6-9 players.
There is a shieldbelt behind the large door in the locker room.
The switch to the door is located on the console next to the
engine room domination point; to get to the shieldbelt before the
door closes, you'll have to either leave your translocator in
front of it or have a teammate hit the switch for you.
The large red button on the panel in the cargo bay opens the airlock
underneath the domination point for about four seconds.  You can
either touch or shoot the button to activate it.

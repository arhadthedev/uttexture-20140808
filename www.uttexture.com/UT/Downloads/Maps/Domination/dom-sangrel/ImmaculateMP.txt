----------------------------------------------------------------
"Immaculate Map Pack" (IMP) Unreal Tournament Map Pack
Not to be distributed commercially without prior written consent
----------------------------------------------------------------
Release Date: 3/18/2000
Filename: Immaculate.zip (Immaculate.umod, Readme.txt)


-Installation:
Open "Immaculate.zip" in your favorite ZIP program (preforably Winzip) and double click on
"Immaculate.umod" to extract the umod file.  Follow the instructions to complete installation.


-Playing the Immaculate Maps:
**IMP Tournament
The Immaculate Map Pack comes with a tournament mode similar to that of Unreal Tournament.
Open the "Mod" menu and click on "Immaculate Tournament" to begin a new tournament.


**Practice
Open UnrealTournament and go into the "Practice Game" menu.  Pick your favorite IMP map,
configure your bots/etc. and play.  We recommend you test each map before creating a rotation,
as you may want to exclude some or include non Immaculate maps.


**1 on 1 (Duels)
DM-[Tournament1, and DM-[Tournament2 were created solely for the perpose of one on one DM.  The
first map is primed for the UnrealTournament weapons, and a huge thanks goes out to Shane
Caudle for THE best texture set ever made: Church.  The second is tweeked for the Infiltration
mod (tested on v2.7) and is perfect for a one on one headshot-rockin' realworld weapon battle.
The map also works with the UT weapons, but the full experience requires Infiltration.

DM-[Tragedy also doubles as a 1 on 1 map, so give that a try as well.

Load these maps in the same manner as a Practice session (see above) - because they're not
in the IMP tournament!


**HolyWars
Download the HolyWars mod from "http://www.planetunreal.com/flatware", then load up a
HolyWars game with any of the provided IMP DeathMatch maps.  This pack is in no way
endorsed by the HolyWars team, so don't email them with anything pertaining to this pack,
unless it's about how much fun you had :)

-Who Made This Thing?:
I want to clear this up from the start this time.  The Congregation of Plovers (TCP) DID NOT
make this map pack.  I (gettewantannabe aka getteW) am the sole member of the TCP staff to 
work on Immaculate.  I lead the team but contributed equally with the other very talented
members of the IMP Staff - Fragswill, MarcEG, Wanderer, Wolf, and Deadman.
We had a problem with FISSION, with people thinking Wolf was part of TCP - he is not, neither
are anyone else on the team.  I mean, we wouldnt mind... :)

Ob1-Kenobi provided the EXCELLENT code for the custom tournament ladder.  He is the key 7th
member of the IMP Staff.  Not to mention the Umod install wizard...


-Troubleshooting:
Slow framerates means you have a average-to-crappy PC.  Turn some more system intensive Unreal
features down in the Advanced Options menu, reachable from the UTed menus or edit your ini.
Or you could buy a new 3dAccelerator... we all will sooner or later.  (Speaking
of which, it's time to dump my Voodoo2... but I aint got no cizash)

If your .umod extensions are not working, head back to www.unreality.org/utmp and grap the .zip
version (which should be available shortly after the UMOD version.)

Do you have version 405b?  That's what you need to play the ladder...

-Thanks to:
Preacher, Epic, DE, UnrealED... for you are god of all things, the muppets, all mexicans
everywhere, the pittsburgh penguins, cletus the slack-jawed yokel, cast and crew of cupid
expecially jeremy pivon-we all love you, bill (king of the universe and all things funny)
murray, and planetunreal for giving me news about unreal and the planet we live on.  Blizzard
and Id for showing me the way.  AtticBat, PsychoWalrus (brush up on yo ut mappin skills!,)
QAPete, Wayne Gretzky THANKS FOR RETIRING>>> YOU'RE FRIEKIN OLD.  A big thanks to those in
#unreality on gameslink, i loves me playtestin!  The mexican literary appreciation council 
of mexico, this dog, and vertigo productions.  Another (second) thanks goes to AtticBat for 
some crucial last minute (and i mean last) testing... you rock!

Also to those who could not be with us for IMP: Entropy, DarkAngel, Spew, Clawfist, and all 
those I forgot.

And of course to Ob1 and the rest of the IMP Staff.


-One Final Note:
I (getteW) made all of the information for the ladder up.  Ob1 was the genius behind
the code, but he should not be held responsible for the poor grammar and information
included.
I also have to say that Ob1 has been one of the best people I have ever worked with, on
anything.  I've had alot of partners in the past that have been unbelievable, and now i
have another to add to the list.  He got me new versions of the code daily, and sometimes
twice a day.  He ironed out bugs 5 minutes after I ICQd him about it... he deserves big
credit on this.

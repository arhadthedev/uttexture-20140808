--- Story ---

Four millennia ago, a prosperous town on Freya became victim of a meteor rain.
Little inhabitants survived the horrible twist of nature, and the few who 
remained, quickly started claiming the barren landscape to grow food and
build their new shelter....They worked hard for their new life, and soon 
grass and other plants started to sprout....

The village started to grow, but not every place on Freya was as pure as 
the other, and people aggressively started to steal, even murder. Two 
clans were eventually formed. People, once loving and caring for eachother 
now slaughtered and emprisoned their former allies. Brutal ways of torture awaited 
for the jailed....

This war, dividing the town into two little villages continued until now.
The reason of this neverending battle has already been forgotten a long time,
but the people never think of stopping the war of their ancestors... for many sick 
minds it has become a sort of twisted game...

....A game of Slaughter....
		          ....Torture....
				          ....Revenge....

....the game of Jailbreak....

Read story :P

It took me some time because of the BSP's and the instant Crater(tm) bug (all fixed)
It supports about 20 players and JBArena so I hope you like the result.

Plz send some feedback to EricEttes@Freeler.Nl

AAhhhhh time for some rest.....

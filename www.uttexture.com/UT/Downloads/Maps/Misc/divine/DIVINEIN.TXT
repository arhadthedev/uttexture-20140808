AUTHOR'S NOTES 
==============

Author-      Bryan J. Hernandez (Dark Elf) E-mail: shadowBow@earthlink.net

Map Setting- An evil shrine of an unknown origin. Made of metal and stone, 
             this metalic beast sits in the middle of a vast ocean. Surrounded
             by darkness, the only signs of life come from the structure 
             itself; a low hum of unyielding energy.

Bots-        Another pathing job complete... I think I'm losing my hair!

Secrets-     One-. 1) Not really a secret but might be hard to find- Under the structure 
                   is a air tight compartment which holds the nuke! Hehe...

                     
Special Features- The crusher trap- At the very top of the level you can find the 
                  shield belt which is protected by a crusher trap that sets off anytime any
                  player steps on one of the 8 panels located throughout the
                  map. This makes it totally unpredictable much like the 
                  trap in DM-Healpod for the first Unreal. The map also features jump pads 
                  which, once again, I was able to get the bots to use (yes! My hair is
                  falling out!).

Author's notes- Credit goes to, Rich (@kuma) Eastwood, for the texture pack included
                with this map- they are the same ones used in his outstanding map,
                DM-Brutality. Thank's Rich!

Special thanks-  Thanks to all the folk's who E-mailed me about DM-Oracle and
                 DM-Rage. The kind words are appreciated!!

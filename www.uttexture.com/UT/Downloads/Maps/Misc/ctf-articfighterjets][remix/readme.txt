Adding these weapons to your Map
---------------------------------
You may use the weapons in your map... 
As long as you mention my name in your readme.  
(You must mention my email adress too: britton_wesley@yahoo.com)

To add the weapons to your map do the following (after making a backup copy of your map) :

1. Open my map.

2. Reopen your map with out closing the editor.  The unreal editor has just loaded all the required files.  You should see the new weapons in the class browser under tournament weapons. Place one of each weapon in your map. The new Jet class is under jet launcher.  Be sure to expand that and selectthe Ghandi Jet Launcher when placing the weapon in your map.

3. Save your map. 

4. Exit unreal editor.

5. Reopen your map.  You are good to go.  

Note: Unreal can be a bit twitch with the my level textures... so don't sweat it if things dont go right the first time just repeat the steps.

Thanks to the U4E MOD team for the drunken missles and flame thrower!

Author's Notes
--------------
An Unreal Tournament Capture the flag map based in an Artic test region.  High Mountains, cold winds, Jet fighter planes and 5 new weapons await!  Pilot your own Jet with Guided missles and a hand eject button.

Story
--------------

------- G weapons lab ---------

In the late 23rd century a quantum physics flunkie realized he was forced to work at McDonalds for a living.  Not a bad living, as over 80 percent of the worlds population worked in the fast food industry.  The rest were either miners or the elite Quantum physists.  Sidney R. Ghandi was not about to take flunkuing the quantum physics exam lightly. He had other plans...

Even through he had a perfect score, so did several others, and the tests were graded on a three dementional elipse (much more stringent than our current bell curve grading system) The QP Dean and the President of the university met to discuss who to select and who to flunk.  They thought about another test but realized that all the candiates were perfectly qualified and could answer any quantum physics question.  So they had another idea... a trivia question... randomly selected for each student.

Ghandi got the following question: 

"What are the only living species of the family Myrmecobiidae?"  

Ghandi was clever. Although he had never heard of the Myrmecobiidae, he realized that the latin root structure of the word refered to Marsupials.  Most of them lived in Australia.  Possum? No, to easy. Kangaroo? Heck no... probably not the platipus.. it laid eggs. "That would be the..." Think man think! "... numbat?" Replied Ghandi.

"Ah," said the QP Dean "that would be correct...except that the numbats are now extinct.  Trick question.  You flunked."

Ghandi steamed.  He had spent his life studying and his families fortune.  He was sunk. It was either work at McDonalds or run across the freeways in Fiji until he was hit by a car.  Two days later he had a plan.  Using his knowledge of quantum physics he would create a new terror weapon.  A weapon so powerful that he could rule the universe.  Thus he set about creating his new weapon with several of the other QP flunkies.  They snuck into the university labs and began developing the prototypes.

As luck would have it a Burger King Janitor, moonlighting on his third job at the university, discoverd the weapons and contacted the authorities.  As the police arrived Ghandi vowed not to go with out a fight.  His cohorts agreed.  Now was the time to put the prototype weapons to the test!

--- Quantum Jet fighters -------------

After defaeating the first three waves of police forces from surronding municipalities, the swat teams were called in.  Ghandi and his cohorts held off a major invasion force for several days with the new weapons.  Finally the police decided to nuke the university lab.  Ghandi figured out their plans and made for a hasty get away with his cohorts.  On the way out they were surrounded.  Ghandi wanted to go out guns blazing but his Ghandinator jammed on the nuker.

He and his cohorts were arrested and put on trial.  It wasn't pretty.  Ghandi was made out to be an evil scientist with plans of world domination. He even corrected the reporters by saying "Not world domination... universal domination! You idiots!"  It looked as if the whole lot of QP flunkies were going to get the death sentence.  

Suddenly during the presentation of evidence, the most high paid, prestigeous attorney in the known galaxy showed up.  His name was Nero Shapiro. Shapiro stated flatly that he wished to reperesent Ghandi and that Ghandis benefactor wished to remain anonymous.  Ghandi quickly agreed to let Shapiro reperesent him.  In a matter of a few weeks Shapiro had reduced the sentence from death to life confinement in a mental instituion for the criminaly insane. This sentence was carried out for Ghandi and his cohorts.

Coincidentaly Quantum Nukes R Us... the leading manufacturer of Quantum weapons had opened a new mental ward not to far from their main laboratories.  Ghandi was to spend the rest of his days in this mental ward.  It did not take a genious to realize that QNRUS was using Ghandi's knowledge to further their own development of weapons.  Ghandi realized that QNRUS was looking at thim with all the glee of a master with new found slave labor.  The best Quantum Physiscists were so highly paid that  they could afford their own countries when they retired.  Ghandi was dirt cheap.

Ghandi ofcourse had other plans.  He viewed the QNRUS laboritory with all the glee of a mad scientist bent on universal domination.  Within the first week Ghandi had developed a small teleporation device which allowed him 24 hour access to the laboritory.  He and his cohorts were back at it.  They began developing new weapons in the basement of the QNRUS laboritory.  They worked quickly and in shifts.  Their goal was to create the utlimate in terror weapons.  Aircraft, Tanks, even space ships.  But they had to keep the weapons small to escape being noticed.
 
Within the first month they had developed a Quantum jet.  A Quantum warp field allowed Ghandi to reduce the jets size and density to be small enough to be carried.  Later the jet could be activated and would return to actual size.  The first prototype jet used a warp field to fire a rocket and then reproduce the rocket through a small loacalized time warp.  The net effect was the jet could fire an infinite number of rockets.

As luck would have it the same Burger King janitor moon lighted at QNRUS (his second job). While cleaning one night he had to go to the basement for more cleaning supplies. He noticed a strange green glowing subtance all over the floor.  It had odd anti gravity properties. It was the same stuff he had found while cleaning Ghandi's sink. Realizing that something was amiss he quickly contacted QNRUS security.

The VP of development was called at 4 in the morning.  When he was told of the situation he said "My god... whatever you do dont kill Ghandi.. and don't destroy those beautiful weapons.  Subdue him but dont kill him."  He quickly Dialed the president of QNRUS... "Pay dirt!  Ghandi has created a whole boatload of new stuff for us. Lets pray he doesn't kill himself in the process..."

Ghandi's army had grown as he had converted the rest of the psycho ward into believing he could alter the course of history...

------- Artic Jet Fighters ------------

Ghandi Easily brushed aside QNRUS Security and escaped.  He took what was needed and did his best to cover his traces.  Some of the weapons had been left behind in the sqirmish and QNRUS quickly put their top people on figuring out how Ghandi's weapons worked.  With in a few days they had replicated Ghandi's technology. 

With the production test of their first beta prototype QNRUS signed a multi billion dollar deal with a defense contractor for the rights to Ghandi's Quantum jet.  

The search for Ghandi continues as world leader fret about his whereabouts. The only notes they could find on what Ghandi was working on related to a "DoomsDay Device."  QNRUS wanted Ghandi back for his profit making potential and were willing to sweeten his deal.  They wanted to be the first to find him and wanted to keep his capture a secret.  So far Ghandi had not dabled with any serious quantum physics aside from the Ghandinator nuker and QNRUS did not think he had completed the DoomsDay Device.  The UN security council and world leaders wanted to take no chances.

Ghandi had vanished for weeks when a nuclear class submarine came up missing.  The guards reported seeing it one minute and then it was simply gone the next.  After giving them drug test and cerebral scans it was found they were telling the truth... 

A secret training facility was set up in the artic to test the new weapons developed by Ghandi.  Two teams were chosen one from the defense contractor and QNRUS security and the other from UN paramilitary forces.  The Red team represents the Defense contractors and the Blue team the UN forces.  After training in the tounament their mission is to locate and capture Ghandi.

Thanx:		Voxel on whose beta_Funnel_II.unr this map is based
		Snoop &
		Ro-Jaws work colleagues who inadvertently beta tested this map for me during lunch times.

This map is based on my map beta_Funnel_II_evo. The architecture consists of two _evo maps joined side by side with one of the maps spun through 180 degrees about the vertical axis. Some of the components had to be removed/remodelled to enable this. I also changed the nature of the cutout below the sniper platform - making it easier to spawnkill! I changed the range of all the sniper rifles so they can hit anywhere within the map (did this on _evo but forgot to say so). Hmmm, and I managed to resist the urge to up the fire rate on the sniper rifle. ;-)

Happy fragging.

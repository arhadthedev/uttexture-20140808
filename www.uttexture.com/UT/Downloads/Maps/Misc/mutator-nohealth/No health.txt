***SUMMARY***
This mutator removes Helth vials, medboxes, mega health, thigh pads, armor and shieldbelts from any UT level.

***WHY?***
I think this is more fair in one-on-one games though you get credits for every time you hit your opponent and the game depends more on combat skills than camping around the shieldbelt or armor...

And also if one is twice as good as the opponent he get twice as many points instead of 5-10 times as much, though he isn´t able to restore the health between each fight....

And I suggest usinig it together with the "No Powerups"-mutator that comes with the game. It makes it even more fair and less reasons for camping...

***BUGS***
None that I know of.

***INSTALLATION***
put NoHealth.int and NoHealth.u in the ...\UnrealTournament\System directory

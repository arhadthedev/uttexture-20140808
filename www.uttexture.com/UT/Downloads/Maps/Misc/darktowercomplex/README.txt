DM-DARKTOWER COMPLEX

Author: Nukey

Date Entered: 6/9/2007

Creation Time: 1 Week of and on the map

Notes: 
This map has way better bot pathing than my first one.

**KNOWN BUGS**:

 1. The bots at the bottom level of the map will not go anywhere on the map, just camp there until you kill them.
 2. If you're playing it on team deathmatch, not always but sometimes, the bot will not listen to you.

Readme

Introduction
-------------
The creation of this map is a long story but to cut the long story short. When I was
about to create a new DarkMatch Gametype for UT I noticed something quite odd... UT
already had a DarkMatch Gametype! Only hidden. So I created a new *.int file that
"unlocked" it accordingly I ported DK-NightOp over to UT and tried it out and it
worked perfectly.

The only differences from the Unreal version are that the pickups have been replaced
by their UT equivalents and the path network has been improved substantially.

For those of you who don't know what DarkMatch is that it is pretty similar to
regular DM except that DK maps are dark (as the name suggests) and that the the only
way you have to light the world is your searchlight...

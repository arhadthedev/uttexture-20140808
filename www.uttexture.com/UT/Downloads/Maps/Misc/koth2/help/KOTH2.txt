*** SUMMARY ***
KOTH is a new "King of the Hill" game type for Unreal Tournament.  It differs 
from the "King of the Hill" game type included with Unreal in that in 
KOTH there are actual hill areas that players must occupy in order to 
score points and win the match.


*** FILE LIST ***
Help\KOTH2.txt : This file.
System\KOTH2.u : The scripts.
System\KOTH2.int : File which puts the KOTH game type into the game menus.


*** HOW TO USE ***
(This is for "users." Server admins and level designers see below.)

First of all, you not only need this mod, but you need levels that are made
to use this mod.  These levels should begin with "KOTH" instead of "DM" or 
anything else.  Note: this is one of the reasons why it is a new gametype
and not a mutator--there needs to be a hill (hills) in a logical place!

Start a new multiplayer game (or botmatch, but bots don't really work yet).
Set "Select Game" to "KOTH".  (If you don't have it, it either isn't installed 
properly, or perhaps you have too many other mods installed.  I believe there
is an internal limit of 16.)  

In the "Rules" tab, you will see a new "Hill Time Limit" option.
This is where you set the number of seconds needed to win a game.  Set 
it to zero if you want no limit (though if you also set the Time Limit for 
game itself to zero the game will last forever).

Thats pretty much it.  Start the game, and have fun!


*** ADDING A KOTH TAB TO YOUR SERVER BROWSER: ***
You can add a KOTH tab to your server browser by following two simple steps:

-First, add the following lines to unrealtournament.ini (which can be found in 
your Unreal Tournament's system directory):

[UBrowserKOTH] 
ListFactories[0]=UBrowser.UBrowserSubsetFact,SupersetTag=UBrowserAll,GameType=KOTH2Game,bCompatibleServersOnly=True 

-Next, find the [UBrowser.UBrowserMainClientWindow] section, and find the first line
which looks like "ServerListNames[10]=None".  Change the "None" to "UBrowserKOTH" and 
that is it!


*** SERVER ADMINS:  HOW TO RUN A KOTH SERVER: ***
Running a KOTH game is like running any other game type. Do note that KOTH 
uses the maps listed in the [KOTH2.KOTH2MapList] section of 
unrealtournament.ini (by default) to determine which maps to cycle through.  
This section will be automatically created the first time you run KOTH.


*** LEVEL DESIGNERS: HOW TO MAKE YOUR MAP A KOTH MAP: ***
It's rather easy, but should you have any problems or issues please
contact me.

Step 1: Load UnrealED, then load the KOTH2 package.  Do this by clicking
"Load" down in the bottom right corner of the screen and opening KOTH2.U.
Yup, that is KOTH2.U, not KOTH.U.

Step 2: You must add one or more "hills" to your map.  Use the class 
browser to open Triggers\Trigger\KOTH2Hill, then place one or more
of them on your map where you want.  The size of the hill is determined
by the "Collision\Collision Radius" and "Collision\Collision Height"
properties of the trigger.  Experiment around to find what's right for you.
KOTH2Hills are invisible, so you probably want to put them where there
is some sort of visual indication in the level, such as a light, circular 
platform, texture, etc.  They work the same way ordinary triggers do, so 
you can use them to make sounds or whatever.

Note that it is possible to overlap hills in order to make a hill with a 
shape other than circular.

Step 3: Save the level and try it out.

PLEASE!: Use the "KOTH" prefix on any KOTH levels you make.

As far as distribution goes, I ask that you please include the KOTH files
with your mod.  Although that presents the usual problem of making sure you
have the right version, etc, the sources are small and it makes it so
much more easier for the users of your level.  The complete set of files
needed are listed earlier in this document.


*** SHORTCOMINGS ***
-Bots don't know how to play (though if they happen to wander onto the hill
they will be scored).  No, I am not willing to code this. I've tried and 
failed.  The UT bot classes are extremely convoluted. In any case, how good 
do you think they would be?  Bots suck at anything other than DM.  If anyone 
else wants to do this go for it--let me know when you have something that 
actually WORKS ;)


*** THANKS *** 
Hobeaux for asking me to make this, BeefEnchilada for 
helping so much with testing, and Wolfchild for making KOTH maps and for 
kicking me in the ass to do this.  Also, I would like to give props to 
Mouse (from RealCTF) and the HolyWars guys, whose code I borrowed from. 
Lastly, thanks to Bungee for making Myth and Marathon, the gameplay 
inspiration.

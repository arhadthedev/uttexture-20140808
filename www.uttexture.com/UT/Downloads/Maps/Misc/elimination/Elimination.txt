If you have any requests for improvements or bugs to report, 
feel free to contact me.  All of my mods and mutators are 
available for download from the Quirky Bastards homepage 
(www.quirkybastards.com).  

*==> Notes

This mod is a new gametype based on the scoring system in 
Last Man Standing.  I played LMS quite a few times, and 
although I enjoyed the scoring method, every time I played it
I wished there was powerups on the map.  I also hated how 
everyone used the same weapon (ie, rockets) because you started 
with them all.  

I highly recommend playing this with weapon stay off, it makes
things much more interesting :).

Now that this is complete, I will be working on a team version of
the Elimination game.  

Have fun!

*==> Changes from Version 1.10->1.20
    - Fixed bug that would declare spectators as winners if they
      joined after the game started.

*==> Changes from Version 1.00->1.10

    - Fixed bug that declared the winner as the one with the most 
      kills, not the one with the fewest deaths.

*==> Features in Version 1.00

    - Each player starts with X number of lives (configurable by setting
      the Fraglimit in the options menu).
    - Maps have their normal items/powerups layout.
    - Scoreboard features kills, lives, ping, and packet loss.

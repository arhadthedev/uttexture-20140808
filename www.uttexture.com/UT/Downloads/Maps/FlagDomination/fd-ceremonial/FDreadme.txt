This map as been adapted to Flag Domination by Eric Pietrocupo.

This is a map for the first Unreal Tournament game. 

I did not actually create this map. I took already made "capture the flag" or "Domination" maps and converted them to Flag Domination. 

I have not kept the original readme.txt files that came with these maps. If you want to find the original authors, look in the "levelInfo.author" field ( Also shown on map start window). I you want the original map, search the name ( minus FD) on Nali City. FD-Storm and FD-Olden were originaly domination map, all the other ones are capture the flag maps.

The Flag Domination mod is a mix between capture the Flag and Domination. There is 3 flag spot in  each base and your gain point with time. The more flags you have, the faster the points increase (like domination).

The only problem is that this mod requires custom made maps. There is currently only 6 maps availlable where 5 come with the mod installation. This is why I decided to make 9 additional Flag Domination maps, since this is a great mod.

The Flag Domination Mod is also available for unreal 2003/2004. For more information, here is the official flag domination web site :

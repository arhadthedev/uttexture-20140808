Known bugs              :One BSP error in the red base, There are lights in
			 the tunnels that have no source this is because
			 the Stupid tunnels kept giving me bad BSP probs
			 when I put the lights in, so I said "Screw it" And took
			 them out, you don't notice when your playing
			 anyway.
			 A couple of textures are off, and I would have to rebuild 
			 half the level to fix them, it's not worth it.

Installation
------------
put CTFM-WaterHazzard.unr in your unrealtournament/maps directory

If you have CTFM-CrystalPower installed you don't need to install 
the texture file as they are identical

Author's Notes
--------------
You need Wyzards MultiCTF mod to play this map get it here
http://www.planetunreal.com/multictf/

I wanted to try something that felt like Wyzard's CTFM-Incinerator.

Thanks Wyzard at the last lan party I went to we had 8 players in 
your map and we spent about 2 hours playing before a team finally 
won. it was probably the most intense UT experience I've ever had.

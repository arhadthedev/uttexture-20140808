Thanks to Cliff Bleszinski for the original layout
The bot support works well, i watched them a long time , just they don't take the shieldbelt
and the udamage in the central area . The bots defends very well . The fun factor in this 
map is pretty good .


I added some stuff like a central arena and the complet rebuild of lightning

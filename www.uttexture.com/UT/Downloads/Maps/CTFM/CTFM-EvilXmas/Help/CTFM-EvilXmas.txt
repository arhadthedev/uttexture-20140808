Installation
-------------
Unzip the file into your UnrealTournament/ directory. 
The files should then unzip into the correct locations:
- CTFM-EvilXmas.unr  in the  UnrealTournament/Maps/      directory;
- UTF winter.utx     in the  UnrealTournament/Textures/  directory;
- UTF.utx            in the  UnrealTournament/Textures/  directory;
- TAcars.utx         in the  UnrealTournament/Textures/  directory;
- TAconeytex.utx     in the  UnrealTournament/Textures/  directory;
- Scotch.umx         in the  UnrealTournament/Music/     directory;
- this CTFM-EvilXmas.txt file in the  UnrealTournament/Help/ directory; 
- start the game and choose the level under the Multi Capture the Flag
  Game type.
***********************************************************************
*** NOTE:   if you do not have the various files for Multi Capture the
  Flag play, then you will need to download them from another site, 
  such as "www.planetunreal.com/multictf/" or "www.fileplanet.com".

  In Internet play, the space in the filename "UTF winter.utx" is a 
  problem.   The file "UTF.utx" is an exact copy of the texture file.

Extended description:
---------------------
CTFM-EvilXmas is Doctor Evil's conversion of Denis "UT-Freak" Reimer's 
deathmatch creation to a MultiCTF map. 

The original deathmatch map, which Doctor Evil found on a UT server 
late one evening in 2004 November, involves many firefights in a 
cathedral and the surrounding streets, including a nearby Christmas 
tree.   The cathedral was the only building that one could enter.
The other buildings were all solid blocks.   The Degenerate Doctor 
especially likes the music that "UT Freak" chose for this map, 
"Scotch.umx".

In CTFM-EvilXmas, rooms have been carved out of many of the 
surrounding buildings and out of the bell tower of the cathedral.
The locations of the four flag bases are clearly indicated by team 
icons on the buildings and by smaller team icons at each principal 
entrance to the base.

The cathedral is now the gold flag base, with the flag at the altar.
The only redeemer in the map is on the cathedral roof, at the far 
end from the belltower.   One needs to break the rectangular window 
on the top floor of the belltower and use the jump boots to reach 
the very narrow ledge on the roof.   The altar alcove, where the gold 
flag is located, is a health zone, regenerating two units of health 
every second, up to a maximum of 100.   However, the central location
of the cathedral makes the gold base a very unhealthy place to be!
A sniper post in the bell tower overlooks the nave on one side and 
the approach to the main door on the other side.   Despite the 
firepower available to gold team bots upon spawning, the gold team 
is usually at the greatest disadvantage in the game.

To one side of the cathedral is the green flag base, in a small 
stone tower.   The main route in, which the bots prefer to use, is 
a cramped stairwell, winding its way up the tower to the flag on 
the top floor.   An alternate route tunnels through a Tudor building, 
up a lift to rooftop level and in through a hole on the roof.   
The tight quarters give quite an advantage to the green team 
defenders.   The safest exit with the green flag is to break a 
window and jump out onto the nearby Christmas tree and from there 
onto the ground.

On the other side of the cathedral is a four story building, the 
Blue Palace.   The blue flag can be found on level 4.   There are 
alternate entrances from the adjoining Tudor house on levels 1 and 2.
Red team bots seem to find the blue flag very quickly, but are less
adept at getting that flag back to their home base.

Beyond the Blue Palace is the Chapel of Flak, home of the red base.
A large red team icon on one wall indicates the location of a simple 
platform lift up towards the red flag, which is at the top of the 
chapel tower. 

The map contains extensive zone information.   With the 
"omniscience" options of MultiCTF turned on, one can quickly tell 
where any flag in transit is.

Many a time Doctor Evil has not even bothered to try to win the 
match, as he is distracted by the therapeutic practice of shooting 
out many of the windows.   The sound of breaking glass seems 
especially fulfilling in the belltower and nave of the cathedral.
Another sacriligeous pleasure is to see the hymn books go flying 
off the pews when they are shot. 

Have an Evil Christmas ...

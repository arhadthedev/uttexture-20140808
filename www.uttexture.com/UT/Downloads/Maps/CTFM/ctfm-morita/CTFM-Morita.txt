Level Info
----------

This map is a CTFM Conversion of the original CTF-Morita, that was originally made by
David Montwe. It is a 4 way crossroad map with many different paths and routes...
The reason I say there are so many, is because it is a type of maze!
(Not that hard to get lost in, so don't worry!) ;)

Thank you very much for the original map Dave. I had a good laugh trying 
to convert it into a 4-team map, but nonetheless I got there in the end! :)

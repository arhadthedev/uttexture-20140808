Author's Notes
--------------

To play this game you need the MultiTeamCTF mod by Wyzard that you can download from:
http://www.planetunreal.com/MultiCTF/

This level is a convertion of the excellent DM-Pressure. Each base are reachable by many 
ways and leads to a furious match where you will die often!!! The four bases were 
equilibrated with teams of 4 players in mind and with smarter bots.. setting a 
heavy defense mod will give a strong advantage to the red base. Omniscience will help 
a lot to find your way in the maze of the level to recover your flag.

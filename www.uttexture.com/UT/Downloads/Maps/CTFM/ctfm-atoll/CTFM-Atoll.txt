--- Level Info and Author's Notes ---

It's kind of an atoll above the 'sky' where 4 teams have there own 'tower'. There are multiple 
ways to get to another tower. 

I am not the greatest mapper, I only try to make some amusing maps, and I make them as good as 
I can, but I don't sit hours working on every inch to look perfect. I always spend much time on 
the bots, so that a single player game can be very fun too, or a LAN game where bots may join 
the fragfest too :). 
About those bots : I played the map several times with some friends on a LAN to see if bots 
sometimes do awful stupid things... I think bots do that on most maps :). Bots do quite well, 
but they jump into oblivion pure suicidal sometimes (maybe it's a suicidal map? :p). 

If you play this map with less than 4 players (bots) per team, it would be rather boring. I would 
recommend 5 to 7 players (if you put "heavy bot defense" to ON, it will be a great challenge,
but with 6-7 bots a team, the bots won't score often). If you prefer 4 bots a team I strongly
suggest to set "heavy bot defense" on ! If you play without that setting (no matter how many 
bots) you will often score an easy one :). I tested the map mostly with 5-6 bots. 8 players is 
cool also, but for some intensive hardcore fragging :).

The map runs very good on a AMD700 with a Voodoo 3. On a Celeron 433 with a Riva TNT1, it isn't 
thát fluent, but playable.
Originally there was a very big center weel with 4 wings, which I thougt would have increased 
the frame rate, but it had the opposite effect, so I had to place those 4 quite ugly 'walls' 
ahead each base to get a descent framerate again. Some spots can cause a little framerate drop, 
but not quite heavy, I couldn't do better, or else the map would have been full of sight blockers. 
Maybe I'll try an indoor map next time :)

I added a descent zoning this time, I could avoid crossing the zone portals the semisolid glass 
this time :).

Instagib can also be very fun here, you're still able to get a flag really (even with 6 bots per
team).

If many people did like CTFM-Penta, I maybe can make a 2-2 version of CTFM-Atoll for another 
dimension of gameplay.

High on Action! Low on eye candy!



This is my first map so be gentle.  It's been play tested to death 
and the bots love it.  This is a re-creation of MAP04 of FRAG4ALL.WAD
of Doom2 fame, the original WAD was created by Christian Antkow
(cant@softchoice.com).


Here's what Christian had to say about his original map:

MAP04 - Death To All    : Made this level while totally smashed at an office
                          party. Had an entire office full of drunk crazees
                          who wanted to see how long it could take me to
                          design a deathmatch WAD. Took me an hour to build
                          this one and we played it well into the wee hours
                          of the morning. This one is a VERY HIGH FRAG level
                          and with four players, it's just INSANE!!! This is
                          my best "Heart-Pounding-Sweat-Building" level to
                          date. Big thanks go out to my Ingram Micro,
                          Symantec, Microsoft and Delrina reps for cheering
                          me on while I slaughtered the other people in
                          the office...


This map is Larger in scale than the original and so it accommodates 8 people 
very well.

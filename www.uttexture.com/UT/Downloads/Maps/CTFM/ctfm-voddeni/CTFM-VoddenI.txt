--- Level Info and Author's Notes ---

I just wanted to create a small hardcore MultiCTF map, I like to play those too sometimes, just
to kick some fraggin' ass :). 
Lighting is ugly, but I didn't had the intention to spend more time for the lighting than I did
for the construction itself, so ... hehe. 

The word "vodden" (dutch) means literally : dirty pieces of cloth, but in my dialect it is used 
in the meaning of damaged, destroyed, etc ... (in other words : gibs everywhere !)
I added a I, so I won't have to invent other names later when I am in the mood of making another
small fragfest map :).

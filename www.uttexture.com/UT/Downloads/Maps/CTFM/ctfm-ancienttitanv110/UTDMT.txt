Permissions: The usual: if you use it please give me credit, you can't use
it for money.  I'm not a lawyer, just don't be a dick.

Special Thanks: Squacky for making the levels and beefenchilada for helping 
me test this.

*** SUMMARY ***

UTDMT stands for Unreal Tournament DeathMatch Titan.  It is a modified 
Titan from Unreal which can take part in UT games.  This means that it 
appears in the scoreboard, has score kept for it, and can win the game.  
In addition, it also sends messages to the other players, taunting them
when it kills them or cursing them when they hurt it.



*** HOW TO USE ***
(This is for "users." Server admins and level designers see below.)

UTDMT is not and really cannot be a mutator.  The DMT needs to be placed in
a level by a person, so to play with him you need one of those levels. 
Might I suggest DM-Titania][ by Squacky?  Get it at

*** HEY LEVEL DESIGNERS! HOW TO USE THE DMT: ***

The class you want to place in your level is 
Actor->Pawn->ScriptedPawn->Titan->StoneTitan->UTDMT

There are a whole bunch of configurable properties of this class.  Default
values have been set to make it so the DMT can be used with a minimum of 
tinkering with these.  They've all been documented them in the code itself, 
so if you want to know more look at the script.  I'll list a few points here:

-All the messages are in the UTDMTMsgs properties group.  

- The characters "%p" in a message are special: they will be replaced with 
the name of the offending player or an insulting name if the player can't 
be determined.

- Prepending a message with the character "@" will cause it to be sent only
to the Titan's teammates.  Note that this is done automatically with 
IgnoreOrderMsgs: you don't have to specify the "@".

-The default messages are specifically for the level DM-Titania][, so some
of them may not make sense in your level.

-Team 255 is no team, 0 is Red, 1 is Blue, etc.



*** NOTES FOR SERVER ADMINS ***

Many of the classes properies are "config," meaning you can set them in 
an ini file for your server.  However, I'm not too sure how this really works
in practice, so you are on your own: I don't run a server, I don't know how,
I can't help you.

One very cool (if you ask me) feature available to server admins is the 
ability to make the titan say what you want it to.  To make every titan say
something, type this into the console:

set utdmt msg [your message here]

To make a specific titan say something, type this:

set utdmt msg #[Titan's name]#[your message here]

To make a titan send the message to his teammates only, prepend your message 
with "@".  For example, to make titan "Bobo" say "eat shit" to his teammates,
type this:

set utdmt msg #bobo#@eat shit

In order to make this really fun you need to enable the chat logger built-in
to the package.  To enable it, you must add the following line to your 
server's ini's [Engine.GameEngine] section.

ServerActors=UTDMT.UTDMTChatLogger 

Also note that you can fiddle with a lot of the titan's properties this way
(like respawn time, etc), though I'll leave the details for you to figure out.

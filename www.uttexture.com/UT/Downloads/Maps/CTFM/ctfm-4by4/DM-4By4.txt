4 By 4 Symmetry inf:

This map is inspired by another similiar map I saw somewhere else that had no name and no credits. It is designed to run very fast with no unusual geometry or special effects. Colors used could be described as 'tacky' in places.

Average polygon counts for this map generally stay below the 100 mark. 

Textures Used : NaliCast

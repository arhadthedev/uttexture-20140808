Description             : A quad-themed MCTF map! 
			Red = Fire: Lava is about and some nice crackling fires, they get Rocket Launcher and Flak Cannon but no power ups. You WILL fall into lava a few times before you learn the structure of the base :-) The base is themed not only firey/volcanic but ancient.
			Blue = ICE: Howling winds and bubbling icy water, they get the ASMD, Ripper, Invisibilty and Big Keg O' Health. Lots of ASMD ammo in the base. The base is themed in mostly icey cave textures.
			Green = SLIME: There's a lovely slime pool in the middle of base, they get Bio Rifle, Pulse Gun, Shield Belt and Power AMP. Cool Flagroom that can hide many defenders waiting to ambush :-) The base is themed not only slimey but urban.
			Gold = BULLET: A Base for the snipers, they get Minigun, Sniper Rifle, Extra Enforcer, Jump Boots and Armour. Watch out for snipers from behind the flag. The base is done a wooden/metal kinda way that looks kinda nice (stop thinking of wagon wheels! hehe)

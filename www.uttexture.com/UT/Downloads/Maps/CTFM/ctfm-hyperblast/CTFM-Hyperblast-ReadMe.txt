Description		DM-Hyperblast converted to CTFM-Hyperblast for Wyzards´Multi-Team CTF


** Map-Information **
SinglePlayer		Yes
New Sounds & Graphic 	No
Known Bugs		None...so far
Note			This is a small and very fast paced map. Green base has a light disadvantage as it is set up in the center (but I think you like challanges). 

** Mapping-Information **
Editor used 		UnrealED2
Constrution Time	Some Days
IMPORTANT		Normal Flagbases are used, so this one should work on CTF4...(i didn´t test it)
			No MCTF-Flagkillzones are used...so no problem with the bug on MultiCTF-Beta4

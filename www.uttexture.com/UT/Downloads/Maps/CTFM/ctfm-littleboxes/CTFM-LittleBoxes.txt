Author's Notes
--------------
You need Wyzards MultiCTF mod to play this map get it here
http://www.planetunreal.com/multictf/

The Title Little Boxes comes from a Pete Seager song of the same name
listen to it and you will understand.

There is no real theme to this map as it is kind of a learning map
that I thought was good enough to release.

This map also works with CTF4 I think.

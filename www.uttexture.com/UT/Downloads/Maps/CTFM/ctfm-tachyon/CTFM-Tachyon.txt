--- Level Info and Author's Notes ---

I noticed that the original map DM-Tachyon by Ulukai was perfectly suited for a MultiCTF map.
I quadripled the map, intersected, added some things here and there, some color light ... The only 
'big' change I did was to stretch the base a bit, because it would be too small, it's still very 
small, but the little arrangement made it a lot better I guess.
I would say, play the original map too and compare :)

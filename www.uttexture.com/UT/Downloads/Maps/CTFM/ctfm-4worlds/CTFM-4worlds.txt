Description : This is a old idea i decided to work on
              There are four different worlds for each team
              - Blue : a space orbital station ( coretFX , spaceFX )
              - Red  : a earth military base down the rain ( rainFX , UTtech2 )
              - Green: a old tech base on a slime planet ( decayeds , genearth )
              - Yellow: a egypt pyramid on sahara ( egypt , egyptpan )

Thanks to Steve Nabors for the script who allow me to concretise my old idea

-Precipitation Generator
-Multi Sky Box Zone 

Custom Music : Chizra1 of Unreal1

I have tested a long time the map , i don't find bugs.
if you find it please raporte me on nalicity

Edit : i think 3 players per team is more adapted
       but you can play with four !  hehe !
       The bots are very hard on this they took the flags
       and score better than me ! aaarrgh !

Have Fun !!

** Map-Information **
SinglePlayer		Yes, BOTS like this one
New Sounds & Graphic 	No
Known Bugs		None...so far
Note			A medium sized map. I added a second elevator in front of the fortress in order to increase access to the gold base. Also the front & side gates are open. But look for yourself..

** Mapping-Information **
Editor used 		UnrealED2
Constrution Time	Some Days, i had to totally rebuild the pathnode-system
IMPORTANT		Normal Flagbases are used, so this one should work on CTF4...(i didn´t test it)
			No MCTF-Flagkillzones are used...so no problem with the bug on MultiCTF-Beta4

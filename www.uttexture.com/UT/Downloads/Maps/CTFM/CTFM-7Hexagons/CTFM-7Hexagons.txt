***********************************************************************
*** NOTE:   if you do not have the texture files "ATATAttackpf.utx" 
  and "lestatpack.utx" in your 
  UnrealTournament/Textures/ directory, then obtain them from 
  another web site.

Doctor Evil regrets that he has insufficient space on his web site 
for these files  ...   yes, really ... riiiiight ...

Extended description:
---------------------
CTFM-7Hexagons was Doctor Evil's first MultiCTF map. 
Six hexagonal rooms are arranged around a central hexagonal 
chamber.   Four of the six peripheral hexagons are flag bases, 
so that the red and green bases are adjacent, as are the blue 
and gold bases.   This makes for some fast and furious action, 
although there is no z-axis action at all on this map. 
    
There is enough room to take a redeemer on a long tour of the 
seven chambers (if the bots will let you live long enough to 
do so).

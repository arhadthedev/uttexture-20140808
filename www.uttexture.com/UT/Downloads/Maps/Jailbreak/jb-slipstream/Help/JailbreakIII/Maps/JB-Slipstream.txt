Special thanks to
-----------------
THE ]V[ATTerminator for making CTF-Slipstream.
Rob for the use of some of his screenshots.
Everybody in the JailBreak community, who inspired me to do something 
usefull with my spare time.


Notes
-----
THE ]V[ATTerminator used DM-Hyperblast for the base of CTF-Slipstream in 
which he mirrored the HyperBlast ship.  I liked playing CTF-Slipstream and 
thought it would be a nice JailBreak level.  Sure, there already was a 
JB-HyperBlast available, but in that map the bases were too close together.  
I left most of CTF-SlipStream in tact (why change a good map), and I just 
added the JailBreak components (Jails, Release Mechanisms, Arena, etc.).

I'm not really a mapper, I'm not really a coder, I just love JailBreak.
Never played JailBreak before? Shame on you!

Installation
------------
Unzip the the .unr file and place it into the maps directories under your 
Unreal Tournament directory. Start a practice session, choose JailBreak and 
select the map from the menu.

First JB map.

Looks ok ---> crap - you decide.

Gameplay is great - I, and others who have tried it find it fun, despite it looking crappy.

Bots work, on the higer levels they use the top paths, but mainle the bottom. They'll snipe and attack. They'll also free you :)

Lighting/textures is kind of alright. Most of the lighting was recently added. Textures are bland in places but you cant really see them properly cos the ap is kinda dark.

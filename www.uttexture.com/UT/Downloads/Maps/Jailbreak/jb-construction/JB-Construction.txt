Known bugs                 : The turrets sometimes don't work. This is because
			     some turrets continued shooting eachother after an 
			     execution. I gave them some health, so they instantly disable
			     eachother when this happens, preventing that annoying noise.

--- Description ---

The level's layout is simple : 2 towers with 3 floors.
It's quite big, so you might want to add more bots than the recommended
number. It has z axis fighting as well as hiding spots and sniping opportunities.

It also has a little surprise... you'll eventually see it :P

--- Description ---

Symmetrical map for Jailbreak, with a difference! This map was designed for lots of spam. The release switches are back to back in the centre of the map. Directly above the switches is a redeemer. There are two snipe points on each side that look down on the release switches. Players spawn deeper in their base, where the jails and most weapons are located. Team turrets protect each inner base. This map was made exclusively for the JELP (Jailbreak Euro LAN Party), 2007.

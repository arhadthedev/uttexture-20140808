Special thanks to
-----------------
Epic for releasing the CTF-Cybrosis-][.
Everybody in the JailBreak community, who inspired me to do something 
usefull with my spare time.


Notes
-----
This is a conversion of CTF-Cybrosis-][, which Epic released themselves in 
BonusPack 1.
I added the JailBreak components (Jails, Release Mechanisms, Arena, etc.) 
and fixed some anoying
botpathing and texture alignments.

Never played JailBreak before? Shame on you!
Get the Mod at www.planetjailbreak.com

Installation
------------
Unzip the the .unr file and place it into the maps directories under your 
Unreal Tournament directory.
Start a practice session, choose JailBreak and select the map from the menu.

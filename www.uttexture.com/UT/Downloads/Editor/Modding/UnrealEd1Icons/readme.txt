UnrealEd 1.0 icon pack for UnrealEd 2.0

This icon pack will change most of UnrealEd 2.0 (Unreal 227, Unreal Tournament) icons to those of UnrealEd 1.0. Use this if you are used to the old icons yet want to use the newer Editor or simply if you like those icons more than the blue themed icons of UnrealEd 2.0.

Installation:
* Back up your System/editorres folder (rename to something like editorres2).
* Extract this archive to your System folder. You can extract it somewhere else and move the new editorres folder to your System folder.

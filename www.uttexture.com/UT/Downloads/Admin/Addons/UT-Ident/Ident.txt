Ident - RFC 1413, Identd for UT

These files supply UT/UT2k4 servers with Identd support.

Installation, Open the server.ini, and find the list of ServerActors, add the following:

UT: ServerActors=Ident.IdentServer
UT2k4: ServerActors=Ident2k4.IdentServer

To configure, add the following to the server.ini

UT: [Ident.IdentServer]
UT2k4: [Ident2k4.IdentServer]

Settings:
ListenPort=113
SystemName="UNIX"
UserName="UTServ"
TimeOut=30
bConnectOnly=True

ListenPort   - The port to listen for incoming Ident requests (Default 13)
SystemName   - Please leave this as "UNIX"
UserName     - The username to report. Please note that server port is appended.
               A server at port :7777 will show up as UTServ7777.
               Also note that the Max length is 10 letters.
TimeOut      - How long after connection is created to wait for commands.
bConnectOnly - Dispose of IdentServer after request is complete (recommended!)
               Setting this to false could potentially give security issues.

Any programmers wishing to use this or have questions can find my email inside the sources.

Have fun and don't whine.

Monster Announcer 1.0 by TNSe

This serverside mod will announce for the rest of the server when a player makes
a multikill (double, multi, ultra & monster).

To install, simply copy the .u file to the system dir,
and add this line to your server .ini file under [Engine.Engine]:

  ServerActors=MonsterAnnouncer.MA_ServerActor

The only configuration you can do, is which level the announcing should start at.
Inside the server .ini file, you can find the following (It will be added first time you run the mod)

[MonsterAnnouncer.MA_ServerActor]
AnnounceLevel=1

The numbers are used for when announcing starts.
1 = Announcing starts at double kill
2 = Multi kill
3 = Ultra kill
4 = Monster kill.

Have fun.

DeathMatch Conversions for Unreal Tournament 400+
Version 100
Created by Jason Brown aka Farlander
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of simple game types which let you play CTF and
Domination maps as either Team DeathMatch or normal DeathMatch.
Why?  Well, I saw that ATD had made one, but at the time it
only converted to Team, and when I tried it I had problems.
However recent versions added normal DeathMatch.  Oh, well.  :)
Still, this took 30 minutes, and leads to bigger projects.
Also, this is a bit smaller than ATD's, but lacks a Server
Viewer.  You can get ATD's from their web site:

In reality, it was very simple.  Just needed to extend
DeathMatchPlus or TeamGamePlus and change some default
properties.  Also, I needed to change some of the logging
stuff, so team games get reported right with ngStats.

Known Problems:
MutliCTF maps which shut of bases when when the score limit is
reached will shut all the bases when the game starts.  Not fun.

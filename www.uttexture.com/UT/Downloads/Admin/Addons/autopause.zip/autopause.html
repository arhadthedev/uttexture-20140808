        0.80</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many months ago I wrote a little 
        utility that would automatically pause games when a player drops. I installed 
        it on our server and we tested it once in a game vs [T], and it worked 
        nicely.. But I never got around to actually releasing it.. But [T]Beefcake 
        asked me a few days ago about it and since it was finished anyway I guess 
        I can put it up for download.. Hopefully someone will find it useful. 
        :)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can be found in the <a href="http://utv.clan-sy.com/download.html">Download</a> 
        section, and it is installed on the server as a server actor, no client 
        download necessary. When a teamgame is started in tournament mode it is 
        activated.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="ap1.jpg" width="538" height="308"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the game is started it 
        will monitor the number of players to see if anyone drops, and instantly 
        pause the game.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="ap2.jpg" width="538" height="380"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the missing players enters 
        the game again, it will count down from five and then unpause. It will 
        also only allow the game to be paused for a certain amount of time per 
        pause, and a total amount per game. These can be set by the admin before 
        the countdown begins. The times are calculated separately for the teams 
        so one team can't use up the others time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, if a team decides they 
        don't want to wait for their missing player one of them can type '<b>say 
        go</b>' and the game will resume. The other time can also type '<b>say 
        hold</b>' to give the other team one more minute of time. An admin can 
        also force an unpause of the game instantly by pressing pause as usual.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To install it on a server, 
        find the section [Engine.GameEngine] and add the line<br>
        <b>ServerActors=AutoPause.APActor</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A spectator or player logged 
        in as admin can use these commands before countdown:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>admin set autopause.apactor 
        enabled &lt;true/false&gt;</b><br>
        Setting this to false will disable autopause even in tournament mode.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>admin set autopause.apactor 
        maxpause &lt;minutes&gt;</b><br>
        The maximum amount of time the game will be paused per pause in minutes. 
        (per team)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>admin set autopause.apactor 
        maxtotalpause &lt;minutes&gt;</b><br>
        The total maximum amount of time the game can be paused. (per team)<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This little utility has not 
        been tested extensively but it have been tested and it's simple code so 
        I don't expect any problems to occur. If however something should go wrong 
        the admin can always issue a '<b>killall apactor</b>' to remove the AutoPause 
        actor from the game, which will stop it from interfering. It will come 
        back the next level though so if it is a confirmed problem it is probably 
        good to disable it then.</font></p>

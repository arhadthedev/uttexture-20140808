TDS Auto Lag Kick is a Unreal Tournament mutator. This mutator does not change game play
what so ever. The mutator monitors every player's ping, if the player's ping is above a 
certain level for a predefined time he/she will be kicked. This mutator is written to 
improve gameplay, because nobody likes a laggy server. This is a server only mutator,
so your clients don't have to download it.

Installation is easy, just install the .umod or unzip the zip file to the \System 
directory. This is a server only mutator, so clients don't have to download it.
To enable the Web based administration you have to add the following to the 
UnrealTournament.ini. In the section [UWeb.WebServer] add the following lines:
  Applications[##]=tdsautolagkick.TDSWebAdmin
  ApplicationPaths[##]=/tdsautolagkick
where ## is the first unused number, by default 2. After this you can access the
web based admin via http://your.ip.here:port/tdsautolagkick

TDS AutoLagKick will be listed in the mutator list and thus make your server be listed
as a "mod" server in ngWorldStats, if you don't want TDS AutoLagKick to be listed in
the mutator list install it as an ServerActor, add the following line to your
server .ini file:

[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerActors=tdsautolagkick.tdsautolagkick

If you do this you can no longer use the `mutate` commands to configure the TDS 
AutoLagKick from within the game. the WebAdmin is still possible.

Configuring is easy. Just open de tdsautolagkic.ini file with your favorite text editor 
and change the values of the options.
KickPing	is the ping from where players will be kicked. Set this to a high number 
		to disable and only use the other functions
KickTime	is the time in seconds that the player has have to have the KickPing in 
		order to get kicked.
StartTime	is the time that a new player will be left alone, this is build in 
		because new players will have a high ping for a couple of seconds. If 
		the player is playing Starttime seconds then he will be monitored for lag.
IllegalChars	is a string with illegal characters, if a player has used one fo these
		chars in his name, he will be kicked. This was put in here to prevent 
		the ~ in players names.
PacketLoss	is the PacketLoss value after which the mutator will monitor the player
PackTime	the player will be kicked after he had the above packet loss for this 
		time
NoKickIP[##]	these are IPs that will never be kicked.
Then in the section [tdsautolagkick.TDSWebAdmin] you have the following options:
AdminUsername	this is the username for the Web Admin
AdminPassword	well this is the password to use with the name
AdminRealm	this is the name of the internet section where this part belongs to.
		If you give this the same name as for the usual Web Admin you don't
		have to retype the passwords (as long as you have the same Usernames
		and passwords)

It's also possible to change these settings from within the game. You have to be 
administrator in order to change it. When you are in the game, open the console (~) and 
type "mutate <setting> <value>". <setting> is one of the following: SetTime, SetPing, 
SetStart. <value> is a plain number.
The following commands can also be used with "mutate"
SaveIP <playername>	adds the players IP to a list with IP that will never be kicked
SaveIPNR <ipmask>	adds the IP to the list of IPs that won't be kicked, this must
			have the following form: 130.89.228.50 or something like 130.89.*
			You can add up to 50 IPs.
GetConfig		will display the current configuration of this mutator
GetVersion		returns the version number of TDSAutoLagKick
TDSDisable		will disable the mutator
TDSEnable		will enable the mutator
AddChar	<char>		add <char> to the Illegal Chars list
			if <char> is <tilde> then it's replaced by a ~
			if <char> is <sqoute> then it's replaced by  a `
SetChar <string>	set the Illegal chars list to <string>

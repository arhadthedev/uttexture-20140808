PlayerJoinDump ServerActor for Unreal Tournament by El Muerte version 100

about
-----
The PlayerJoinDump ServerActor will dump info about every player
that joins during the game. Only real players are logged, no spectators,
spectators can't be logged the way I coded this ServerActor.

install
-------
It's very easy to install, just add PlayerJoinDump.PlayerJoinDump
to the server actors in the server  configuration file

result
------
The information about the players will be dumped in the server log
file in the following format:
[PLAYER_JOIN] <player name> <ip:port> <current netspeed>
Every player will be listed in the log every the play in a game, that
means that after a map change the players will be listed again.

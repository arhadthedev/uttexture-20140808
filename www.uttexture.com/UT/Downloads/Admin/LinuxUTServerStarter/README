Linux UT Server starter by El Muerte [TDS] (thekiller@cuberjunkie.com)
version 106

Creating a shell script that can keep your UT server online is pretty
easy to write, but to use it is a bit harder. For example when you want
to shutdown the server, you first have to lookup the right PIDs. You
could also start the server twice by accident. Well those are the
main reason I wrote this advance server starter. It allow you to start,
stop or restart the server with one command.

Installation:
Copy the files in this archive to the base directory of Unreal 
Tournament. Be sure that the following files have execute rights:
- startutserver
- randgen
Make a copy of startutserver for every UT server you are going to run
on that system. Now edit that startutserver script so that it uses
the right settings to start the UT server.

note: you may want to edit the maplist files (BotPack.* , SFGame.*)
included with this package if you use a random startup map.

After you've edited the files your ready to run the server, type:
	./startutserver start
to start the server
	./startutserver stop
will stop the UT server _AND_ the script
	./startutserver restart
will only shutdown the server, if the script is still running a
new UT server will be started.
You may want to start the script in the background:
	./startutserver start&
or if you want to create a log file of all the output of the script
	./startutserver start > logfile.log&

Known issues:
If you find a good way for a random number generator within
Bash let me know, I want to get rid of the randgen program, using
the $RANDOM variable doesn't work right.
It could happen that the randgen program doesn't work on your
system, in that case recompile the randgen program (the source
is located in randgen.c)

I'm open for suggestions and improvements, just send a email to

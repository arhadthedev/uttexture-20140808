              3. Configure your web server to allow directory browsing for the specified chat log directory.
                 Note: a web server is not required if you want to just look at the files locally.

              4. Start the UT server

              5. Open your web browser and go to
                 http://YourServersIPaddress/yourwebchatlogdirectory

                 Note: You can look at the current games chatlog while the game is still in progress 
                       with Internet Explorer but this will probably not work with Netscape Navigator.

               UTils v2.3 by PJMODOS (aka [TTH]Prayer)


[=====------ииииииииии      WHO WHAT WHY       ииииииииии------=====]
MODOS Utils are server actors that was originaly created by me for
my UT server:
TeamBalancer - actor that balance teams when any user writes 
               "MUTATE BALACETEAMS" in console.
AutoRecorder - actor for automatic serverside demo recording.
MODOS ScoreBoard - changes ScoreBoard to show more info.
SplashLogo - Allows you to display texture (logo) at begin play.
             If you don't know how to create UT texture package
             with logo see LogoHowto.txt.
             It will NOT show logo on servers with UTPureRC5b, 
             but should work with UTPureRC5b2 and later.

See History for latest changes.


[=====------иииииииии       INSTALLATION       ииииииииии------=====]
Installation is easy, just place the MODOSUtilsV23.u file in your
system directory and start editing the server .ini file.

Add the following lines to the [Engine.GameEngine] section:
ServerActors=MODOSUtilsV23.TeamBalanceActor
ServerActors=MODOSUtilsV23.AutoRecorder
ServerActors=MODOSUtilsV23.MODOSSBServerActor
ServerActors=MODOSUtilsV23.SplashLogoSA

First line is for TeamBalancer, second is for Autorecorder, third
is for MODOS Scoreboard and fourth is for SplashLogo.

If you use MODOS ScoreBoard or SplashLogo you must include
this line too:
ServerPackages=MODOSUtilsV23

And if you use SplashLogo you must include this:
ServerPackages=logopackage
(replace logopackage with name of your texture package)

Now the AutoRecorder configuration, add the following section to the
same server .ini:
[MODOSUtilsV23.AutoRecorder]
bAutoActivate=False
Password=
DemosDir=../Demos/
DemoNameFormat=%L_%M-%D-%Y_%H-%I

MODOS ScoreBoard configuration -  add the following section to the
same server .ini:
[MODOSUtilsV23.MODOSSBServerActor]
ShowClickBoard=True
ShowBonusInfo=0

And SplashLogo configuration -  add the following section to the
same server .ini:
[MODOSUtilsV23.SplashLogoSA]
LogoTexture=logopackage.logotexture
LogoDrawTime=6.0
CaptionLineOne=
CaptionLineTwo=
CaptionLineThree=
CaptionLineFour=
(replace logopackage with name of your package and logotexture with name of your texture)


[=====------иииииииии          SETUP          ииииииииии------=====]
Detailed description of configuration.

AutoRecorder configuration:
- bAutoActivate : If set to True then auto demorecording will start
                  at the begining of every map, otherwise it will
                  record demo when user writes "MUTATE SERVERDEMO"
                  in console.
- Password : If you allow users to start demorecording you can set
             password, so only users that have password can start
             recording. I you leave this empty password is not
             required for start recording. Syntax for recording if
             password is set is "MUTATE SERVERDEMO PASSWORD".
             Password is case sensitive.
- DemosDir : Directory where to place demos (with trailing slash and without spaces).
- DemoNameFormat : Pattern for demo name. Following flags are
                   replaced:
                   %L - Level Name
                   %M - Month
                   %D - Day
                   %Y - Year
                   %H - Hour
                   %I - Minute
                   %S - Seconds
                   %N - ServerName

MODOS ScoreBoard configuration:
- ShowClickBoard : If you want to see green flag at playername
                   in tournament mode when player is ready set
                   this to True. If you are using UTPure and want
                   ClickBoard I recommend to set ClickBoard in UTPure
                   to False and in MODOS ScoreBoard to True.
- ShowBonusInfo : 0 = Nothing, 1 = NetSpeed, 2 = Efficiency.
                  This work only if 16 or less players are on server
                  and resolution of player is 800x600 or more.
                  In DeathMatch and LMS can't be showed both PL and
                  BonusInfo, so if you set this to 1 or more then only 
                  BonusInfo is showed in DM and LMS.

SplashLogo configuration:
- LogoTexture : Package and texture name.
- LogoDrawTime : How long is logo showed in seconds.
- CaptionLineOne   : Text
  CaptionLineTwo   : that will be
  CaptionLineThree : displayed
  CaptionLineFour  : under logo.

[=====------иииииииии     VERSION HISTORY     ииииииииии------=====]
v2.3
+ Fixed bug in ClickBoard - green flag didn't show in DM and LMS in
  tournament mode
+ Fixed bug in TeamBalancer - now never change the team of a person
  carrying the flag

v2.1
+ Completely rewritten demoenhacing code. This mean that bug with 
  crashing UT when spectator was in game while recording is fixed.
  Also "unlimited spectators can join when maxpectators is more than zero"
  bug is fixed. And last thing changed with new demoenhacing code is
  that MODOSViewFC now don't work (I'm not replacing spectator but only
  scoreboard and hud so I can't write functions which can be called from console)
+ Changed ShowNetSpeed to ShowBonusInfo (you can select netspeed or efficiency,
  for more read documentation above). If you want more options than netspeed 
  and efficiency write me (with my new replication code I can add anything now).

v2.0
+ Fixed problems with my custom spectator used for demoenhacing
+ Added function for spectators to fast switch to FlagCarrier or
  best fragged (type MODOSViewFC in your console or bind it to some key)
  in my custom spectator in MODOS ScoreBoard (also work in demos)

v2.0b3
+ Fixed problems with Valhala Avatar (new NetSpeed replication code from UsAaR33)
+ Serverside demos recorded with MODOS ScoreBoard will be enhaced with it
  (Standard server demos have DM HUD without ScoreBoard, demos with 
  MODOS ScoreBoard have correct HUD and MODOS ScoreBoard)
+ Information message when player is forced to change team in TeamBalancer
+ Months(%M), Days(%D), Hours(%H), Minutes(%I) and Seconds(%S) are now 
  with leading zeros in AutoRecorder

v2.0b2
+ Fixed "Clickboard is active even if tourney mode is not" bug
+ Option to turnoff Clickboard
+ SplashLogo should now work but it seems that it will not show logo
  in first map (after starting server) after first join.
+ Another bug in configuration of MODOS ScoreBoard fixed (netspeed should now work)
+ Any "mutate" command cause "Cannot start demorecording now" message bug fixed

v2.0b
+ Added SplashLogo
+ Added clickboard (green flag shows at player name when he is ready in
  tournament mode) to MODOS ScoreBoard (thx to TNSe who gives me code for PureFlag)
+ NetSpeed is showed properly in MODOS ScoreBoard from now
+ Each teams average ping and packet loss in MODOS ScoreBoard
- Removed limitation for user request only after game starts - now
  user requested demos can be recorded before game starts in tournament mode
+ Information if demo can be recorded or not when user request it
+ Posbility of password protected user requested demorecording
  (MUTATE SERVERDEMO PASSWORD)
+ Added some bugs I am sure :)))

v1.7
+ Bug in configuration of MODOS ScoreBoard fixed

v1.6

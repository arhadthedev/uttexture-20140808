Topic: Unofficial UnrealED Manual
BY: Skarz (help@skarz.com  /  www.skarz.com)

VERSION: 0.5


NOTE: This is NOT an official manual for UnrealED. This manual was NOT made by Epic! It was made by me, Skarz. I just took a bunch of info from the official Unreal Tech page and put it all in a nice neat help file that can be run from UnrealED for quick reference. I offer this  for free.



Installation:
Put the unzipped files in the same location as your unrealed.exe file. It should be in Unreal/System/ directory. Then just run UnrealED as normal. To use the manual, just press the "F1" key!


Plead from Skarz:
If you pass this manual around, please do so with the three original files (unrealed.hlp, unrealed.cnt, and this ReadMe.txt) If you make a link or have a local copy on a website, please credit me by putting a link to my newz page at http://www.skarz.com/   Thank you and enjoy!

<h2>How to add custom textures</h2>
<p>Prerequisites:<br>
  Everything under <a href="index.html#TheBasics">The Basics</a><br>
  <a href="HowToAddCustomPackages.html">How to add custom packages</a> (for import 
  method 2 only)</p>
<p>Overview:<br>
  Adding at least some of your own textures is a must for giving your map a unique 
  look.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic methods for importing them. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h1 align="left">1. Create your textures</h1>
<p> How you actually create your textures is up to you, but you'll typically want 
  to use one of these products:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jasc.com/">Paint Shop Pro</a> costs about $100 and seems 
  to do much of what Photoshop does, at a drastically cheaper price.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
  creating textures, it should be *more* than enough.<br>
  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</a> usually 
  goes for around $500.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're lucky enough to have access to this, 
  it is very nice and is an industry standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was lucky enough to 
  be able to upgrade to the full version of Photoshop from Photoshop: LE for $100, 
  but since then they've bumped up the price of that upgrade significantly.<br>
  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshople/main.html">Photoshop: LE</a> 
  goes for around $100 and is another good choice. &nbsp;It's a scaled down version 
  of Photoshop, which is cool because you'll be able to follow the many Photoshop 
  tutorials and books that are out there.<br>
</p>
<p>There are a number of other photo editing programs that come bundled with scanners, 
  web cams, and digital cameras that may very well do the trick as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;You 
  could theoretically use Windows Paint to create 8-bit BMP files, but you'll 
  be *severely* limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could also render images using a 3D animation 
  package.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Lightwave has a feature called SkyTracer, which 
  could be used to generate SkyBox textures. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> There are certain types of effects textures that you create within 
  UnrealEd.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to cover that topic here, but you can go 
  to <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Fire/AnimatingTextures.htm">Unreal Animating 
  Real-time Textures Manual</a> for more info. &nbsp;These are for creating &quot;algorithmic&quot; 
  animated textures for things like fire, sparks, lightning, and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're 
  very cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if you initially create textures from scanned-in photographs or 
  from a digital camera, you'll still need to use photo editing software to crop, 
  enhance, and convert the images.</p>
<p> The height and width of your textures need to be &quot;powers of 2.&quot; 
  &nbsp;In other words, both the height and the width need to be one of these 
  numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256. &nbsp;UnrealEd will let you import 
  higher res images (512, 1024, etc), but the Unreal 1 engine will not render 
  those correctly. &nbsp;The height and width do not need to be the same, so a 
  64 x 32 image is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>2. Convert your textures</b></h1>
<p>If your textures are already .BMP or .PCX files in 8-bit color, you can skip 
  to step 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, you'll need to use your photo editing software 
  or an image converter to get them into that format.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to convert 
  your images to 8-bit (256 colors) and save them as either .BMP or .PCX files.</p>
<p>The procedure for this is different depending on which software you use, but 
  I'll give an example of what I do from Photoshop to give you the basic idea.</p>
<p>If I have a 24-bit color image in Photoshop that is cropped and ready to go, 
  this is what I do:</p>
<p>* Select &quot;Save For Web&quot; from the File menu. &nbsp;Though that is 
  designed for conversion to JPG and GIF files, I find the GIF conversion to be 
  excellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since GIF files are in 8-bit color, conversion from GIF 
  to PCX is easy.<br>
  * Set output format to GIF and adjust dithering options until I have something 
  that looks decent.<br>
  * Pull up the GIF file and then choose &quot;Save As&quot; to save it as a PCX 
  file. </p>
<p>If you have a lot of images you need to convert, you might instead use an image 
  conversion utility.&nbsp;&nbsp;A really excellent Freeware image viewer/converter 
  is called <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  cool thing is that you can do &quot;batch&quot; conversions of entire folders 
  full of files.</p>
<p>The next step is to actually import your textures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="left"><b>3a. Import method 1: Using the UnrealEd user interface</b></h1>
<p align="left">In UnrealEd, make sure &quot;Textures&quot; is selected in the 
  <i> <b>Browse</b></i> drop-down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press the Import button at the bottom-right 
  of UnrealEd. &nbsp;Select your texture file (or multiple texture files) and 
  then you'll see this window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/ImportTexture.gif" width="334" height="250"></p>
<p align="left">The name of the texture will default to the filename (minus the 
  .pcx or .bmp).&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time you import textures, you'll want to 
  create a new texture package that you'll put all of the textures related to 
  your map in.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're using this method, you'll need to distribute 
  this .utx file with your map.&nbsp;&nbsp;So make up a name for your new texture 
  package - perhaps the same name as your map or some meaningful category - and 
  type that in the &quot;Package&quot; value.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also create multiple 
  texture packages, but unless you have a huge number of textures, that's not 
  necessary.</p>
<p align="left">You can type something in the Group value to categorize your texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
  is strictly for convenience when selecting textures in the editor, but it's 
  a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organize your textures into a small number of categories 
  like &quot;Skins&quot;, &quot;Weapons&quot;, &quot;UserInterface&quot;, &quot;Misc&quot;, 
  or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if you type &quot;Ladder&quot; as the Group, your 
  texture will act like a ladder in your map.</p>
<p align="left">Don't worry about the Masked check box for now - masked textures 
  will be covered in a separate tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also don't worry about the 
  bump map option - I'm pretty sure the Deus Ex version of the Unreal engine does 
  not implement bump mapping.</p>
<p align="left">You usually want to keep &quot;Generate Mipmaps&quot; checked; 
  that option will generate a number of smaller versions of your texture that 
  will automatically be used by Unreal 3D engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time it 
  makes sense to uncheck this is for 2D elements like HUD display icons or DataVault 
  images.</p>
<p align="left">Hit Ok or &quot;Ok to All&quot; and then be sure to press the 
  Save button at the bottom of the Texture Browser to actually save your .utx 
  texture package.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>3b. Import method 2: Use a .uc file to import the textures into your own 
  package</b></h1>
<p> An alternate method is to use import files to import textures into your own 
  .u package. &nbsp;If you're using your own package anyway, this can be an advantage 
  since that means one less file to distribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to use this 
  method, but there's no right or wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>For information on setting up your own packages, see <a href="HowToAddCustomPackages.html">How 
  to add custom packages</a>.</p>
<p>Under your package folder, you may want to add a &quot;Textures&quot; folder 
  or something like that.</p>
<p>Create a text file in Notepad or your favorite text editor and type in a texture 
  import line for each texture you want to import.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's an example 
  of a texture import file:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#000000">class Textures expands 
  Object abstract;</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#000000">// Weapon textures<br>
  #exec TEXTURE IMPORT NAME=LaserGunTex1 FILE=Textures\raygun_barrel.pcx GROUP=Skins 
  FLAGS=2<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#000000">// DataVault images<br>
  #exec TEXTURE IMPORT FILE=Textures\Image01_LibertyIsland_1.pcx NAME=Image01_LibertyIsland_1 
  GROUP=UserInterface MIPS=Off<br>
  #exec TEXTURE IMPORT FILE=Textures\Image01_LibertyIsland_2.pcx NAME=Image01_LibertyIsland_2 
  GROUP=UserInterface MIPS=Off<br>
  #exec TEXTURE IMPORT FILE=Textures\Image01_LibertyIsland_3.pcx NAME=Image01_LibertyIsland_3 
  GROUP=UserInterface MIPS=Off<br>
  #exec TEXTURE IMPORT FILE=Textures\Image01_LibertyIsland_4.pcx NAME=Image01_LibertyIsland_4 
  GROUP=UserInterface MIPS=Off </font></p>
<p>The value after NAME= is the name that you will reference in UnrealEd. &nbsp;It 
  doesn't have to be the same as the filename.&nbsp;&nbsp;The value after FILE= 
  is the filename.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the location is relative to your package 
  folder, so if your textures are in a folder called Textures under your package 
  folder, you'll have to put a &quot;Textures\&quot; in front of the filename.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  value after GROUP= is the same as the Group value described in Import Method 
  1 above.</p>
<p>Save your file as Textures.uc (or whatever you want) in the Classes folder 
  under your package folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure that the filename matches what's 
  after the word &quot;class&quot; at the top of the file, or you'll get an error 
  when you build your package.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can organize your textures in as 
  many .uc files as you'd like.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also put texture import statements 
  in with other import statements and even script code if you want to.</p>
<p>There are a couple of optional things you can add to a texture import line.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  FLAGS= value is optional.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't use a FLAGS value, your texture 
  will be set up with the normal defaults.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the valid values 
  you can use:</p>

<p>Even if you don't set any of these, a surface with your texture on it can still 
  be manually set to any of these later.&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Masked&quot; setting 
  is the most common option.</p>
<p>Another option is the MIPS= value.&nbsp;&nbsp;This works just like the &quot;Generate 
  Mipmaps&quot; option in Import Method 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't include this, 
  mipmaps *will* be generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;So put MIPS=Off in your import statement 
  if you're importing a 2D element like a HUD icon or DataVault image.&nbsp;&nbsp;(it 
  actually doesn't hurt anything to have the mipmaps generated, but it's a bit 
  of a waste)</p>
<p>To rebuild your package, exit UnrealEd if necessary, delete your .u package 
  file from your \DeusEx\System folder and do a &quot;ucc make&quot; from an MS-DOS 
  command prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire UnrealEd back up, and your textures will be 
  ready to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4. Animated textures (optional)</h1>
<p>Importing animated textures is very easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating them is the hard 
  part.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about how to create 
  animated textures - that's up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could take a few frames 
  from some video footage, render some frames with a 3D package, or manually create 
  individual frames in a paint or photo editing package.</p>
<p>For some examples of animated textures, look at the CoreTexMisc package.&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
  are a variety of textures for using on display screens and video screens, such 
  as the ones starting with &quot;News_A&quot;.</p>
<p>Using &quot;Texture Import Method 1&quot; described above in step 3a, import 
  a series of textures for your animation frames (that are the same size).&nbsp;&nbsp;Be 
  sure to put 01, 02, 03, etc at the end of the file names.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you 
  do, UnrealEd will automatically detect the sequence as an animation and assign 
  the correct animation values to each texture.</p>
<p>After the textures import, right-click on the first texture in the sequence 
  (in the texture browser). &nbsp;If your textures imported properly, the Animation 
  -&gt; AnimNext value should be set to the second image in the sequence.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/AnimatedTextureProperties.gif" width="333" height="175"></p>
<p align="left">Each &quot;AnimNext&quot; value will point to the next image in 
  the sequence until the last texture, which will not have an &quot;AnimNext&quot; 
  value.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not seeing any animation when you play your map, 
  you may want to double-check these values.</p>
<p>You may need to experiment with the frame rate of your sequence.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
  typical animated texture is around 5 - 20 frames long, so a good starting point 
  is around 5 - 10 frames per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't change the MaxFrameRate 
  and MinFrameRate values, the frame rate will default to a very fast value, and 
  the animation may play faster than you can see it.</p>
<p>To use an animated texture on a brush (or whatever), just use the first texture 
  in the sequence.</p>
<p>To preview the animated texture &quot;in action&quot; in the UnrealEd 3D view, 
  hit the real-time preview button (it looks like this: <img src="Images/RealTimePreviewButton.gif" width="20" height="20"> 
  ) </p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>5. Detail textures (optional)</h1>
<p>Detail textures are additional textures that can be &quot;added&quot; to a 
  regular color texture to give it a bit more, uh, texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are 
  usually grayscale images that are tiled independently of the main texture and 
  sort of fade in as you get closer to a surface. &nbsp;You could think of them 
  as fake bump mapping, though even that isn't really accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
  are used to give a texture a bit more depth, such as a stony or metallic surface.</p>
<p>To see an example, load in the HK_VersaLife texture package and select the 
  &quot;cube1&quot; texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click on it, pull up its properties, 
  and expand the Texture category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that the DetailTexture value 
  is filled in.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/DetailTexture.gif" width="350" height="223"> 
</p>
<p align="left">Now load in the CoreTexDetail texture and check out the DMetal_A 
  texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead and use the cube1 texture in a map to see how it 
  looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice how it changes as you get closer?</p>
<p align="left">The basic idea is to take a base texture and assign it a detail 
  texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;The detail texture gets tiled separately from the main texture, 
  and its scaling and visibility changes with the distance from the player.</p>
<p align="left">The final result looks crappy here since the screenshot is reduced, 
  but in the game it looks pretty decent:</p>
<p><img src="Images/cube1.gif" width="128" height="128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Images/DMetal_A.gif" width="128" height="128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Images/DetailTextureExample.jpg" width="128" height="128"></p>
<p>One thing you can do to if you have a &quot;video display&quot; type of texture 
  is set its DetailTexture value to the CoreTexDetail.DScanline texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
  will give it an &quot;interlaced video&quot; look, though you'd think that in 
  30 years (or whenever Deus Ex is supposed to be), we'd all be using non-interlaced 
  displays.</p>
<p>You can create your own detail textures; they are just normal textures.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
  best results, try to make them so they look good when tiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 
  you may want to make them grayscale, but that's not a requirement.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>6. Ladder textures (optional)</h1>
<p>As I mentioned briefly, you can make your own ladder textures.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
  you set the Group value to &quot;Ladder&quot; when you import a texture (using 
  either import method), your texture will act like a ladder in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd 
  naturally want to use it on a vertical surface. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;For best results, 
  you may want to investigate &quot;masked textures&quot; which I'll eventually 
  be covering.<br>

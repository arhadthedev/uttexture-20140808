  ReadMe for 226f to 225f compatibility map converter
*******************************************************

- Extract the contents of this rar into your unreal\maps folder
- Make a backup copy of the map you wish to convert
- Run dosprompt/commandprompt
- Locate folder unreal\maps (example: "cd c:\unreal\maps")
- Type in the command:

Mc <mapname.unr>

where mapname can be the exact name of a map, or a '*' to indicate all maps.
NOTE: it doesn't support long names, so if you're sure you're entering the
      correct name but the program cannot find the file just remember to
      use the old DOS format (i.e. "mc Skaarj~1.unr")

example: "mc mymap.unr" will convert only mymap
	 "mc *.unr" 	will convert all maps


Once converted, the map should run well on both 224 and 225.
Anyway, there is one more optional step (recommended):

- Start unrealed and open that map you just converted
- Then just save it


CONGRATS!! Now you should have a map fit for 225f :)

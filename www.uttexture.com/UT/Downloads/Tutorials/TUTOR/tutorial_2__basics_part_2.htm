    </u></font><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana"><big>The Basics Part 2</big></font></b><font
    SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="4"><font face="Verdana"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Actors
    and Brushes and Classes oh My:</font></strong></font></p>
    <p></font><font SIZE="2"><font face="Verdana">Ok, after doing the first tutorial and
    sitting in #unrealed for a day, I&#146;ve noticed that most people working with UnrealED
    are stuck in a Quake/Quake 2 editing mindset. You need to get out of that mindset and it
    will make editing in Unreal harder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">In Quake/Quake 2 editing, you laid out brushes to form levels.
    Everything you created (with the exception of monsters and weapons) were built out of
    multiple brushes laid against each other. A wall was a brush.. a room was at least 4
    brushes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Unreal is totally different. Throw away any 3D editing knowledge
    you have. A brush in UnrealED is VERY different from a brush in Quake. Let&#146;s take a
    quick look at UnrealED&#146;s terminology!</font></p>
    <p></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>The World:</strong></font><font SIZE="2"
    face="Verdana"> When you first start a new level, you are presented with a huge solid
    block of matter. This is your world. Anything you do, be it create a room, place a
    monster, whatever.. is done in the world. I like to think of the world as a huge block of
    clay that you can manipulate.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>Your Brush:</strong></font><font SIZE="2"
    face="Verdana"> Notice I didn&#146;t say &quot;A brush&quot; or &quot;your brushes&quot;.
    In Unreal there is ONLY ONE brush. Think of the brush as your cookie cutter that you will
    use to remove clay (or in some cases put clay back in) to your world. Now it&#146;s
    important to realize that your brush does not exist in the world. It is simply a template
    you will use to build things. The brush can take on many forms from a cube to a sphere and
    through vertex manipulation much more is possible. HOWEVER.. your brush will always be (at
    least as far as we have found out) a simple geometric shape. Don&#146;t expect to build a
    custom brush of a cube with a sphere on top.&nbsp; </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>Actors:</strong></font><font SIZE="2"
    face="Verdana"> I know most of you are use to hearing the word Actor associated with
    creatures and things inside the game (like weapons). In Unreal, anything that exists in
    the world is an actor. This includes walls, floors, monsters, lights, EVERYTHING.</font><font
    SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana" size="4"><strong>HOW DO I:</strong></font><font
    SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Ok.. let&#146;s get in to a few how do I do this sections. The
    information here is the best I know of! If you know a better way to do one of these
    procedures.. please let me know&#133;</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>HOW DO I COPY A ROOM.</strong></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One of the most asked questions of the day was how do you make a
    copy of a room you created. Copying rooms in UnrealED is preaty simple. You just select
    all of the actors that make up the room and hit <font color="#FFFFFF">CTRL-W</font> (the
    hotkey for duplicate). Let&#146;s use the sample level from the first tutorial.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Load up the level by pressing <font color="#FFFFFF">CTRL-O</font>
    and selecting TUTORIAL1.UNR. You should now be looking at the level you created in the
    last tutorial. We want to make a copy of the main room (the one without the slope) and the
    hallway.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">So we pick any of the 2D views (I&#146;ll chose the side view).
    Now we don&#146;t want the brush confusing us so click on <font color="#FFFFFF">MOVE</font>,
    then click on the 2D view you want to work in, then press <font color="#FFFFFF">B</font>!
    You should notice the bush is now no longer to be seen. You can bring the brush back by
    press <font color="#FFFFFF">B</font> again, but for now let&#146;s leave it off. Notice
    however that the brush is only hidden in your current view. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Ok, so we have hid the brush and now it&#146;s time to select the
    rooms. We will do the hallway first so find a wall/ceiling/floor (I&#146;ll call these
    linedefs from here on out) and click on it while holding down <font color="#FFFFFF">CTRL</font>.
    The room should turn yellow (which means it&#146;s selected).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now go to the main room and do the same thing (click on a linedef
    while holding <font color="#FFFFFF">CTRL</font>). Your whole room and hallway combination
    should be highlighted. If you have any lights or starts in these room click on them as
    well. You must select every actor you wish to copy. Now, I think you can use the <font
    color="#FFFFFF">Select all Inside</font> icon to speed this up, but I haven&#146;t figured
    it out yet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Once everything is select it&#146;s time to copy.. Press <font
    color="#FFFFFF">CTRL-W</font> and UnrealED will make a duplcate of the geometry and place
    is slightly offset of your original room. Now position it on the other side of second room
    (the one with the ramp). To do this.. hold down <font color="#FFFFFF">CTRL</font> and
    either mouse button, then move it in to place. Press <font color="#FFFFFF">F8</font> to
    rebuild and now you have 2 rooms that are exact duplicates of each other.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></font><font size="4"><font face="Verdana"><strong><font color="#FF0000">HOW DO I
    ROTATE A ROOM.</font></strong></font></p>
    <p></font><font SIZE="2"><font face="Verdana">Ok.. now let&#146;s hook that hallway up
    with the second room. But wait&#133; the hallway is on the wrong side. Don&#146;t sweat
    it.. we will just rotate the rooms to fit properly. Once again, select all of the actors
    you wish to rotate. Click on the <font color="#FFFFFF">Rotate Brush</font> icon with the
    room selected. Now rotate the brush until it faces to opposite direction (with the hall
    touching room 2).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><em>A note about rotation: As you can see.. MAJOR skewing occures
    when rotating. If anyone figures out how to fix that.. please EMAIL me right away.</em></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></font><font SIZE="2" color="#FF0000" face="Verdana"><strong>HOW DO I SCALE SOMETHING
    IN ONLY 1 DIRECTION</strong></font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">This is called constrained scaling. In UnrealED you accomplish
    this by locking down a vertex in the direction you do not want to move. The best way to
    show this is to create a column. Click on <font color="#FFFFFF">Use Tube Brush</font> (if
    you don&#146;t see the brush in one of your windows.. remember to click on the window and
    press <font color="#FFFFFF">B</font> to make it appear). Move the brush so it&#146;s in
    the second room and size it&#146;s width to be column like in width. Make sure it is
    sitting flush against the floor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Our next step is to pull the column up to the ceiling. To do this,
    we are going to do a constrained scale. First step, is to lock one end of the brush (in
    this case.. the end against the floor). Select the brush and then hold <font
    color="#FFFFFF">ALT</font> while clicking on any of the vertexes on the floor. This will
    put the little X over the vertex (like we saw in vertex manipulation). That face of the
    actor is now locked in place and will not scale. Click on the <font color="#FFFFFF">Constrained
    Scale</font> icon and scale the column to the ceiling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Before we go any further, let&#146;s unlock the brush. Hold down <font
    color="#FFFFFF">ALT</font> and click on the vertex in the very center of the brush. This
    will unlock it. (if you tried to scale it right now, it would scale at both ends).
    Finally.. click on <font color="#FFFFFF">Add brush to World</font> to make the brush an
    actor. Press <font color="#FFFFFF">F8</font> to rebuild.</font></p>
    <p></font><font size="4" color="#FF0000" face="Verdana"><strong>HOW DO I DELETE AN ACTOR</strong></font><font
    SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">God that pillar is ugly.. let&#146;s delete it. To delete an actor
    from the world.. pick a view and press <font color="#FFFFFF">B</font> to hide the brush.
    Now choose the actor you want to delete (in this case.. click on a linedef that makes up
    the pillar). It should highlight. Now press <font color="#FFFFFF">DEL</font> on your
    keyboard and answer poof.. gone (of course.. you might have to press <font color="#FFFFFF">F8</font>
    to rebuild before the 3D display will update). Remember.. press <font color="#FFFFFF">B</font>
    to bring your brush back.</font></p>
    <p></font><font size="4" color="#FF0000" face="Verdana"><strong>SOME OTHER USEFULL THINGS</strong></font><font
    SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">I just want to take a second and go over some other useful
    &quot;quirks&quot; and features of the editor. I&#146;ll be breif..</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">1) The editor stores different window layouts for each map so you
    can set it up to what&#146;s best for you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">2) If you press <font color="#FFFFFF">P</font> in a view... that
    view will automatically update when you change something in another view. Pressing it
    again turns this feature off. Unfortunately you must do it manually for each window and it
    doesn&#146;t even give you a message to what it&#146;s done.</font></font></p>

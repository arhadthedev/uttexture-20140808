    Tutorial #1<br>
    </font></b></u>Getting to know UnrealED (revision 5.24)</font><b><p><font color="#FF0000">Introduction:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>This is the first tutorial in a set I&#146;m working. It&#146;s actually an update of
    one I released late yesterday. We have found out a lot more information about the editor
    and the effects.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial, we will go over some of the basics of Unreal Editing, how to use the
    engine, the tools, etc. We will also cover some of the terminology. Some of the
    information may be incomplete as we are just figuring everything out myself. If you have
    any suggestions, corrections or additional information please drop me some email at </font><a HREF="mailto:mrsin@creativecarnage.com"><font SIZE="2">mrsin@creativecarnage.com</font></a><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">. It&#146;s my hope that tutorials like this will help us all
    figure out UnrealED faster.</font><b><font FACE="Verdana"></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The Editor:</font></font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>When you first start UnrealED, you will be presented with a complex set of windows and
    toolbars. That will look something like the following&#133;</p>
    <p align="center"><a href="http://www.creativecarnage.com/unreal/main.gif"><img src="main.gif" width="623" height="349" alt="main.gif (84116 bytes)" border="0"></a><br>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana" size="1">(click on the image to view full size)</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>Now your screen layout may very (ie: I&#146;ve changed mine around to suit me). The
    first thing you will notice are the 4 view windows on the left. These are Top (upper
    left), Side (upper right), front (lower right) and 3D view (lower left). It&#146;s in here
    you will see the actual blueprints to your level. </p>
    <p>On the very right edge of your layout is your browser. Here you can view the differnet
    objects within Unreal. By default, this browser shows you all the textures you have
    currently loaded. </p>
    <p>Between the views and the browser is your command toolbar. Here is where you select any
    of the action you are going to perform. Everything from rotate to adding/subtracting a
    brush is selected from here.</p>
    <p>Finally a standard Win95 menu bar is found on the top of the screen.</p>
    </font><b><font FACE="Verdana"><p><font color="#FF0000">The Command Toolbar:</font></font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>The command toolbar is very important. It&#146;s here where you will go to select how
    to interact with the level you are designing. Many of the icons are self-explanatory and
    some of the more dificult ones will be covered in later tutorials. Let&#146;s look at the
    most commonly used icons:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="toolbar.gif" alt="toolbar.gif (30869 bytes)" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="555"></p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Move/Move Faster:</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> </b>These 2 icons reset the controls of the editor to their default (move). I
    don&#146;t suggest ever using Move Faster as you tend to lose whatever it is your working
    on.<b></p>
    <p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Rotate Brush:</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
    </b>Select this icon when you wish to rotate your current brush.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Scale Brush (No Snap):</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> </b>Select this icon to scale your current brush without snapping
    it&#146;s movement to your current grid size.<b></p>
    <p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Scale Brush (Snap):</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> </b>Same as above, but snaps it to your current grid size.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Constrained Scale:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> This icon allows you to scale an object from a given edge.&nbsp; </p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Skew Brush:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> This allows you to skew a brush in order to deform it&#146;s shape.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Position Texture:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> This icon allows you to quickly reposition a selected texture
    move scrolling it up/down/left/right.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Rotate Texture:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> This icon allows you to rotate a selected texture.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Use Cube/Sphere/etc:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> These icons (the bottom 8 on the very right of the toolbar) are
    used to select which BRUSH you are going to be working with. The place down very basic
    shapes that can then be used to design your world.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Add Brush to World:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> Click on this icon to add a brush to the world. What this
    actually does will become very clear in a minute.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Subtract Brush from World:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> This will remove a brush from the world. Like the icon above,
    it&#146;s purpose will become clear in a minute.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p></b><big><font color="#FF0000"><big>Controls:</big></font></big></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>The first thing you need to learn about the editor is how to move around in it. There
    are some specifics that you need to know and they will be covered here.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Scrolling around your map (2D views):</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> When you are in one of the 2D views (top, front, side) you use
    the mouse to move your viewpoint. Simply click (left or right) on the map and move the
    mouse to change your view. If you wish to zoom in or out, you need to hold both mouse
    buttons down.</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Scrolling around your world (3d view):</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> The controls to move around in your 3D view are a bit different
    depending on which mouse button you use. If you press the left mouse button, horizontal
    mouse movement will turn you left and right while vertical mouse movement will move your
    viewpoint in and out. If you press the right mouse button you will be locked in place, but
    be able to turn in any direction (left/right or up/down). This is good for reorienting
    yourself. Finally, hold down both mouse buttons and you now strafe in the direction you
    move the mouse.</p>
    <p>So the mouse buttons effect how you move around in the view&#133; well how do you
    interact and move brushes/actions? It&#146;s simple&#133; you use the CTRL and ALT keys!</p>
    <b><p></font><font FACE="Verdana" size="3">Interacting with Brushes/Actors:</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> To interact with a brush/actor, select it then hold down <b>CTRL</b>
    while performing a function upon it. In this mode, your mouse buttons restrict the
    directions in which you can modify the brush. For example, to scale your brush, select it,
    click on the scale ICON, hold down CTRL. You are now ready to scale it. If you hold down
    the left mouse button, you can only scale the brush left to right. If you hold down the
    right mouse button, you can only scale the brush up and down. Hold down both buttons and
    you can scroll them in any direction.</p>
    <p>Notice I stayed away from X/Y/Z! When you make an adjustment to a brush the adjustment
    is relative to the view you are using. For example, on the side view, up/down motion makes
    the brush taller while on the top view, the same up/down motion makes the brush wider.</p>
    <b><p>ALT</b> is an EXTREMELY important key used to modifying brushes. This toggle allows
    you to directly modify the vertexes that make up the brush. You will use this feature to
    create slopes and other strange shapes.</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">WHAT... Only 1 Brush?</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>I know many of you reading this have been building Quake and Quake 2 levels for
    years&#133; working with UnrealED is VERY different than building a level in Q/Q2!
    UnrealED works much more like the Build editor that came with Duke Nukem (made by 3D
    Realms). Unlike Q/Q2 editors you do not simply place polygons in space and hope you
    don&#146;t have any leaks. In UnrealED you start with a huge solid mass and carve rooms
    out of it.</p>
    <p>Think of it this way.. instead of building a house of cards (like in Quake/Quake2) you
    have a huge block of clay. You create your level by cutting rooms out of the block of
    clay. Of course at any time you can add clay in to the empty spaces you created.</p>
    <p>With this said, you really only have 1 brush. This brush is more like a cookie cutter
    in that it is used to shape the world before you delete (or add) part of it.
    Confusing&#133; a little but once you start working with them, everything will become
    clear.</p>
    <p>The best difference between UnrealED and Q/Q2 editing is little to no compile time. A
    huge map in Unreal takes less than 1 minute to rebuild on my P2-333 where even a medium
    map in Q/Q2 would take 20-30 minutes. Of course with UnrealED you also see exactly what
    you are going to get.</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">On Tap for Today:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>So now that we have a good idea of how to use the editor. What are we going to do with
    it. In this tutorial we will create 2 rooms connected by a hallway. We will go over basic
    editing principles, learn how to add lights and actors. We will also take a quick look at
    altering the geometry of a brush through vertex manipulation. So, let&#146;s being.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</font><font color="#FF0000" FACE="Verdana" size="3"><b>Building Our First Room:</b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>Let&#146;s place down our first room. On the command toolbar, select the <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Use Cube Brush</b></i></font> icon. A cube will now appear on your
    view windows. Move your view until you see the cube brush. You will probably want to move
    the cube to a new location so click on the <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Move</b></i></font>
    icon, select your brush in one of the 2D views and hold down both mouse buttons. Position
    it until your happen. Remember to adjust it&#146;s position in all 3 views.</p>
    <p>Once you have your room where you want it, you need to carve it out. But before we do
    this step, we should decide what texture we want to assign to them.</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Picking your Textures:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>It&#146;s a good time to take a look at the browser. On the very right side of the
    layout you have the browser. It&#146;s here where you go to pick textures or select actors
    to add to the game, etc. To select which set of objects to browse you use the pick list at
    the very top. By default this list is set to TEXTURES. The other types are Classes (actors
    and effects), SoundFX (sounds) and Music. For right now we are concerned with the Textures
    so let&#146;s talk about them.</p>
    <p>When you select textures, you will be shown a listing of the textures in the current
    texture set. You can use the scrollbar to view them all. Underneath the pick list for the
    browser (when browsing textures) is a pick list that will display all of the textures
    groups currently being used in this map. You can quickly use this to jump between the
    different texture groups.</p>
    <p>To load a new texture group (so you can pick textures from it), you want to click on
    the <b>LOAD</b> button at the bottom of the browser. You will then be given a list of .UTX
    files. These are Unreal TeXture files and have the graphics stored in them. You can use
    textures from inside ANY of these files.</p>
    <p>You will notice on the browse that right above the display of textures there are 6
    buttons. The middle 3 determine how textures are displayed in the list. either 1 at a
    time, side by side or several at once.</p>
    <p>Now that you know how to pick textures, let&#146;s finish off our first room. Load the
    texture group STARSHIP.UTX. Now pick a nice wall texture. For our example I choose <i><b>BLUE1</b></i>.
    Highlight Blue1 and then click on the <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Subtract from World</b></i></font>
    icon. BOOM&#133; you should now see a room on your 3D view. This is a good time to
    practice moving around in the 3D view to get used to how it works. In time, it will become
    very natural.</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Changing Textures:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>We now have a hollow block (ie: a room) that&#146;s all one texture. Preaty damn ugly.
    Well it&#146;s very simple to change the appearance of a wall, etc. Let&#146;s start by
    changing the ceiling to a better texture. In the 3D view, click on the ceiling of the
    room. Notice how it highlights. Now go to browser and pick a new texture. For this example
    I chose <i><b>BASE_SHD</b></i>. Double-click on the texture and you will see it change in
    the 3D view. But wait&#133; UnrealED scales the texture to fit the whole ceiling and now
    it&#146;s too big.</p>
    <p>To alter the scale or rotation of a texture, select it, right-click and select Surface
    Properties (Alt-P). You will be given a menu with 6 different options.. Effects, Rotate,
    Pan, Align, Scale and Editor. For this example, we are only interested in Scale so click
    on it. The quickest way to scale the texture is to use simple scaling. This will adjust
    both the U and V scale by a given percent. </p>
    <p>It&#146;s important to remember that UnrealED trying to fit the texture to the plane.
    This means the numbers you see here the first time you come to this menu MAY or MAY NOT be
    correct. In our case, they probably are not. So click on <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Apply</b></i></font>
    under the simple Scaling and see what it does. Ah... much better. Take some time and
    change the floor to something better.</p>
    <p>Ok, so the ceiling are floor are now preaty but you don&#146;t like the texture you
    chose for the walls. It&#146;s ok.. changing them is just as easy, especially since
    UnrealED allows you to select and work on more than one surface at a time. In the 3D
    view&#133; move your viewpoint inside of the room. Point at the first wall and click on
    now. Now rotate around and hold down <i><b>CTRL</b></i> while clicking on all of the other
    walls. You will notice that they will all get selected and you can now work on them all at
    once.</p>
    <p>What some of your textures on the wall didn&#146;t line up? There are 2 icons on the
    command toolbar that are used to align textures. These are <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Position
    Texture</b></i></font> and <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Rotate texture</b></i></font>. Take
    some time and play with them and get used to how they work.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p><font color="#FF0000">On to the Hall:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>Ok we built and textured our first room so let&#146;s keep moving and build the hall.
    Remember that with Unreal you only have 1 brush and that brush is probably already on the
    screen. Click on the <i><b>Move</b></i> icon and select the room you just build in any of
    the 2D views. You should now be able to move the brush to a new location.</p>
    <p>Reshape the brush so it&#146;s hall shaped (a long cube should be good and position it
    where you want the hall to go. Make sure one end of the cube touches one of the walls of
    your first room. You also want to go to the side or front view and make sure the hallway
    sits on the ground or close enough so the player can get in to it (for this example, place
    it right on the ground).</p>
    <p>Once your brush is in place, pick a texture and <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Subtract
    Brush from World</b></i></font>. You should now be able to see in to the hallway from your
    original room. If not the rooms where not touching. If you made a mistake, press <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>UNDO</b></i></font> and try it again.</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Two rooms with a view:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>It&#146;s time to create the second and final room. Follow the steps above for a
    hallway, but this time, don&#146;t line up the floors. We the hallway to enter this room
    above ¼ of the way up the wall (you will see why in a minute). Remember it&#146;s
    important that the room touches the hallway at the points of intersection.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p><font color="#FF0000">Vertex Manipulation:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>At this point.. SAVE YOUR MAP!&nbsp; Vertex manipulation in UnrealED is buggy at best.
    &nbsp; I suggest always saving right before you do any.&nbsp; The biggest bug is that you
    cannot drag a vertex on to another vertex.&nbsp; Try it for kicks.. crashes the editor
    toot-sweet!</p>
    <p>Right now you are probably wondering why I had you make the hallway enter ¼ the way up
    the wall. Simple, we are going to build a ramp that allows a player to walk up to the
    hallway. This is an important step since it&#146;s teaches how to do Vertex Manipulation.</p>
    <p>Vertex Manipulation allows you to modify the shape of a brush. You can make a cube in
    to the slope, etc. So how do we do this! You should already have a cube brush selected.
    Click on the <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>MOVE</b></i></font> icon and move the brush so
    one end of it touch the wall connected to the hallway. Now <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Scale</b></i></font>
    the brush until it is grid block higher than the lip under the hall. Stretch it out a bit
    to make a subtle slope. </p>
    <p>Once your block is set, you need to perform some vertex manipulation to make the slope.
    Click on <i><b>MOVE</b></i> then click on the brush until it&#146;s selected (you might
    have to slide the mouse slightly while holding down <i><b>CTRL</b></i>). Once the brush is
    selected, go to the upper corner that is furthest away from the hallway. Hold down <i><b>ALT</b></i>
    and click on it. You should notice a little + sitting on that vertex. This means that
    vertex is select and you can now move it.</p>
    <p>While holding down <i><b>ALT</b></i>, drag the vertex until it is 1 grid above the
    floor. While your doing this, you will notice a diagonal line will be drawn. This is
    showing the change in the brush. You will also notice you may not be able to move it all
    the way down (you run out of mouse space). That&#146;s ok&#133; just reselect the vertex
    and move it again! Keep going until it is one grid above the floor.</p>
    <p>You should now have a box with a line going from the vertex closest to the hallway to
    the close to the&nbsp; floor. You need to pull down the other vertex to make a true slope.
    Try it now. Hold <i><b>ALT</b></i> and click on the other vertex and drag it in to place.</p>
    <p>For some reason, you must have 4 sides on the cube. Everytime I tried to make a perfect
    slope through vertex manipulation, UnrealED would crash. This is why we left the 1 grid
    square block at the bottom (and why we started 1 square above the lip). Move the block in
    to position so it starts right at the top of the lip.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>If you did everything right, you should now have a slope the go 1 grid square under the
    floor. Because we don&#146;t want to waste this space, we want to Deintersect the brush
    with the world. Click on the 4 icon down and the further to the right (see the list
    above). Bingo, your brush now fits the room perfectly.</p>
    <p>Now what.. well we need to add material back to the world. So click on the <font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Add Brush to World</b></i></font> icon and your ramp will be added.
    Texture to taste!</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p><font color="#FF0000">The Rebuilding Process:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>So you have created your 2 rooms and a hall, textured them and now it&#146;s time to
    compile your level. GOD... don&#146;t we all just hate compiling&#133; I had one Q2 level
    that took hours on my P2-333 to recompile. Well.. forget it! Rebuilding in UnrealED takes
    seconds. I suggest rebuilding after you build each room or so.</p>
    <p>Press F8 and you will be presented with the rebuilding menu. Click on the rebuild
    button and bingo.. your done! </p>
    <p>WAIT.. my level disappeared from the 3D View. It&#146;s ok.. read on..</font><font FACE="Verdana"><b></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Let There Be Light:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>The reason your level disappeared in your 3D view is because it&#146;s pitch black. The
    3D view by default shows the level with Dynamic lighting on. Since we haven&#146;t put in
    any lights, you can&#146;t see anything.</p>
    <p>Go to the 3D View and select mode. The first two options on the mode menu are Dynamic
    Lighting and Textures. Select textures and bingo, now you can see everything again. I tend
    to work with just Textures on, then switch to Dynamic light when we place the lights.
    Switch it back to Dynamic lighting.</p>
    <p>So how do we place a light. It&#146;s really simple. Pick on room on one of your views
    (I suggest using front or side) and right click. Select the option Add Light.</p>
    <p>That&#146;s it. You now have a light in the room. You should notice on your 3D view
    that you can now see something. If not, move your eye point around until you can. You can
    move the light source like any other object. Click on it, hold down CTRL and move it to
    the ceiling.</p>
    <p>Place a few more lights around the level until you set the mood (I&#146;ll deal with
    lighting in a later tutorial).</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p><font color="#FF0000">It&#146;s Almost Time:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>We are almost ready. All that&#146;s left is to place the Player start location. Each
    map must have a player start location. Go to the Browser and click where it says <font color="#FFFFFF">TEXTURES</font>. The player start location is under <font color="#FFFFFF">CLASSES</font>
    in the drop down box (I&#146;ll deal with this area in much more detail in a later
    tutorial) so select <font color="#FFFFFF">CLASSES</font>.</p>
    <p>Now you will see a bunch of different classes in the game. Select <i><font color="#FFFFFF">NAVIGATION POINT</font> </i>and down on the list you will see <i><font color="#FFFFFF">PlayerStart</font>.</i> Click on player start and go to your views. Pick
    which room you want the start in, right click in the room and select <font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Add
    PlayerStart</i></font>. DO NOT TRY DRAGGING the class over as on my machine it will crash
    the editor.</p>
    <p>Once again rebuild your level (so the lights take effect) and save it to disk. I
    suggest creating a UserMap directory under your UNREAL\MAPS dir and storing all maps
    there. It&#146;s now time to test your level.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Verdana"><b><p><font color="#FF0000">Learn From My Mistakes:</font></b></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>If you have a GLIDE capable video card AND a voodoo/voodoo2 card... DO NOT... I REPEAT
    DO NOT&#133; try playing the level from inside the editor. You will get a mutal exclusion
    error and total screw up your Unreal settings. Instead save the level, close the editor
    and find your level using my computer. Just double click on the level to load it in
    Unreal.</p>
    <p>A couple of other things that might help you. Make sure you have plenty of RAM. When I
    first tried the editor I had only 64 meg.. and it ran like SHIT! After upgrading to 128meg
    of ram.. it runs great.</p>
    <p>Also, make sure you have no other background takes loaded. Press CTRL-ALT-DEL to bring

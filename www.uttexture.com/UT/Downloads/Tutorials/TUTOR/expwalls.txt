ASSUMPTIONS:

This tutorial assumes you know how to make a mover and set it up with a trigger. If you don't, I suggest reading the trigger tutorials on unrealed.net

TUTORIAL:
     First make your level... now make your wall you want to have explode... make it into a mover.. Now put the mover in your level.. set its KeyFrame1 to someplace outside your level.. Now add an ExplodingWall next to it.. (its under effects)... next set your mover to the folowing properties..

Events
     Event - B1 (or whatever you name your ExplodingWall)
Mover
     bDamageTriggered = TRUE
     bTriggerOnceOnly = TRUE
     bDamageThreshold = 20.0000 (make it higher if you dont want the alt fire blaster to break it...)
     MoverEncroachType = ME_IgnoreWhenEncroach
     MoveTime = 0.0000
Object
     InitState = TriggerOpenTimed

Now change the folowing properties on the Exploding Wall

Events
     Tag - B1 (same as Event on the mover..)
ExplodingWall
     GlassParticleSize - Play around with the size until you get what you want for the effect....
     WallTexture - Set it to your walls texture...


     You should now be all set.. rebuild and test out your level..Have fun.. word of advice tho.. try not to make the particles to big or they will look dumb also play around with the number of Wall Pieces... but again try to keep it low as it will slow down that part of your level if you have like 200 pieces :)

    </b></u></font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF">SkyBoxes</font><p><font face="Verdana">Before
    you begin, please have your display set to 1024x768 if possible. It is absolutely
    dreadful, in my opinion, to run UnrealEd at any other resolution. Also, if this seems
    confusing in any way, feel free to come to Efnet #unrealed and ask me there, please do not
    email me. I use the nick Orion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Also, PLEASE read the readme.txt that came with your unreal game
    and the first two tutorials. They are extremely invaluable, and will help you
    tremendously.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">If you are in a quake/duke3d/doom mindset about skies, please
    remove yourself from this mindset right now. A sky in unreal is much different. Think of
    it this way: The ceiling of any room can be used as a television set, and there is a
    camera way off in space somewhere aimed at a sky. If that sounds confusing, dont fret. You
    will understand. Let's Proceed.</font></p>
    <u><p><big><strong><big><font face="Verdana">Step 1</font></big></strong></big></u></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Create your basic square room. Resize it so that it suits you and
    subtract it. I have found that all of my favorite textures are in the PlayerShp texture
    file. Now, in the 3d view, right click on the ceiling of your newly created room and bring
    up it's surface properties. Be sure that you only have the ceiling selected, or it will
    cause problems later. In the surface properties, click on the <em><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Effects</font></strong></em> tab, and click the checkbox <font color="#FFFFFF"><em><strong>Fake Backdrop</strong></em></font>. Close the surface
    properties window.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>
    <p></font><img src="first.jpg" alt="first.jpg (73261 bytes)" WIDTH="533" HEIGHT="577"><u></p>
    <p><big><strong><big><font face="Verdana">Step 2</font></big></strong></big></p>
    <p></u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now move your brush somewhere else, completely unrelated to the
    room you just constructed. Make the room shorter than the room you just build off to the
    side, and select a sky texture (there is a nice cloud texture at the bottom of SkyBox).
    Subtract. You should now have something that looks like this:</font></p>
    <p><img src="second.jpg" alt="second.jpg (18966 bytes)" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="347"></p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><big><big><font face="Verdana">Step 3</font></big></big></strong></u></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now you will add a <font color="#FFFFFF"><em><strong>SkyZoneInfo</strong></em></font>
    tag into the room that looks like a sky. This is in
    &quot;Classes-Info-Zoneinfo-SkyZoneInfo.&quot; Right click inside of your skybox, and
    select <em><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Add SkyZoneInfo here</b></font></em>.</font></p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><big><big><font face="Verdana">Step 4</font></big></big></strong></u></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Right click on the ceiling of your skybox and select Surface
    Properties. In the far right column, click the checkbox that reads <strong><em><font color="#FFFFFF">U-Pan</font></em></strong>. Add a playerstart in the first room that you
    created, some lights in both rooms, rebuild, and run your level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">When you ran your level, were you able to see a &quot;box&quot; of
    sky, and able to see 3 sides of your skybox? If so, here is how to fix it. Simply delete
    your skybox and create a much shorter one. Move the lights into it as well as the
    zoneinfo, and you are set. If that does not fix the problem, you can make your original
    room a little taller.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Here is what my final product looked like:</font></p>
    <p><img src="third.jpg" alt="third.jpg (24364 bytes)" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="342"></p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><big><big><strong><font face="Verdana">What did I just do?</font></strong></big></big></u></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">You just used a technique known as a &quot;skybox&quot; to emulate
    a sky in unreal. The ceiling of your first room acted as a television set, looking through
    a camera (SkyZoneInfo actor) pointed towards the sky. Now, any other wall that you select
    a &quot;fake backdrop&quot; on will look through the same camera.</font></p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><big><big><font face="Verdana">What if I want to use another sky somewhere,
    with a different texture?</font></big></big></strong></u></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">You will have to create a new room directly over the room you want
    to have a different sky on, and subtract square brushes inbetween to make
    &quot;windows&quot; to your new sky.</font></p>

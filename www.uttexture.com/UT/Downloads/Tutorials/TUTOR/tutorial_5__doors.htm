    <p><font face="Verdana">Okay, so you have your nice little level but you want to make a
    door. This is how you do it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">First thing first, we need to design our door. There&#146;s
    nothing special about this, you can choose any style you want. For this level I&#146;m
    just going to use a thin rectangular slice for the door:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="DoorR-2.jpg" width="616" height="447"
    alt="DoorR-2.jpg (125485 bytes)"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>
    </font></font><a href="http://www.creativecarnage.com/unreal/DoorR-2.jpg"><font
    face="Verdana" size="1">(click here to view full screen)</font></a><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">To make this door I just created a thin slice with my brush,
    selected my texture, and added it to the level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now we need to make it move. To make a mover that looks the same
    as our door we need to intersect it with a large, off-level bounding box. The door we just
    created is nothing but a template, and will be discarded in the final version. To make the
    bounding box you <b>need</b> to use cube properties. If you don&#146;t, your final mover
    will have ghost zones (It looks like its there, but when you touch it you fall/pass
    through). Why would it do this? I&#146;m not sure, but it has to do with scaling. If you
    make your huge bounding box by scaling then your eventual mover door will be scaled by the
    same proportions (as your huge bounding box); and where there&#146;s scaling on a mover,
    there&#146;s ghost zones. All of that being said, lets get back to making the bounding
    box. <b>Make sure your cube brush has reset all transforms (use right-click -&gt; reset
    -&gt; reset scaling) before making the bounding box. If not, some scaling transforms can
    sneak into your final bounding box (even though you used cube properties to define its
    size).</b> Usually a cube of 1000/1000/1000 is sufficient, but if you have a huge door you
    can easily make the cube bigger. Move this cube brush off to the sides and subtract it.
    You should have something like this going on in your level:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="DoorR-3.jpg" width="629" height="456"
    alt="DoorR-3.jpg (110279 bytes)"><br>
    </font><a href="http://www.creativecarnage.com/unreal/DoorR-3.jpg"><font face="Verdana"
    size="1">(click here to view full screen)</font></a><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Now, make your door template into a brush (use right-click -&gt;
    copy to polygons -&gt; to brush) and place the brush in the bounding box. Add the brush
    and delete the original door template. When you do this you need to reapply textures and
    other effects. (You don&#146;t have to do it the way I did it, you can make the door in
    the middle of the bounding box straight off, but I prefer making it in the level first so
    I can see how it fits/looks.) Now, select the huge bounding box and make a brush out of it
    (use right-click -&gt; copy to polygons -&gt; to brush). Then, click on the intersection
    button on your toolbar (far right, third down). The resulting red outline is your mover
    brush. Move it to any part in a level where you want a door and hit the add-mover button
    (far right, sixth down). For this level we&#146;ll just move it to where the door was and
    stamp it. It should look something like this:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="DoorR-4.jpg" width="633" height="459"

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">There&#146;s your door mover.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Making it move is the easy part. Select keyFrame 1 (right click
    -&gt; mover keyframe -&gt; key 1), move it to where you want to go, then select keyFrame
    0. It&#146;s done: compile and run. See Unreal/Help/ReadMe.txt for more info on setting
    different triggers up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Now, the beauty of this method is that it doesn&#146;t
    matter how you created your door. You can skew, rotate, and scale to your hearts content.
    Just as long as you make your mover brush by intersecting with the <b>non</b>-scaled, huge
    bounding box.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">Happy Editing&#133;</font></p>

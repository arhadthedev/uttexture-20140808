Unreal Music (UMX) Ripper by Tom Grandgent
------------------------------------------

Intro/Notes
-----------

This program will extract music files (S3M and IT) from Unreal's UMX files.
I have noticed that certain players (such as MikIT) have difficulty with
the resulting S3M files, and I am not sure why.  However, WinAmp seems to
be able to play them.  The IT files seem ok with any decent player.
This program works with all of the UMX files that come with the retail
version of Unreal, except for one.  I cannot guarantee that it will
work with future UMX files, but it probably will.

Usage
-----

Copy the umxrip.exe file to your \unreal\music directory and run it
with the filespec of the UMX files you want to extract from.  For
example:

umxrip *.umx

If you need more detailed instructions, do this:

Open a DOS window, and type the following commands followed by enter
on each line:

c:                 (or whatever drive Unreal is installed on)
cd \Unreal\music   (substitute the proper Unreal directory if needed)
copy e:\temp\umxrip.exe   (substitute wherever you put umxrip.exe)
umxrip *.umx

And now you should have a bunch of IT and S3M files.  Enjoy!

Players
-------

WinAmp will play all of the music included with the retail version of
Unreal.  However, there are higher quality players out there.  My
favorite is MikIT, but it has trouble with most of the S3Ms (the ITs
play perfectly though).  It can be found at:

Another good player is the Unreal Player (no relation to the game, heh):

A good DOS player is Cubic Player.  It also has the capability to
record music to WAV files.  It can be found at:

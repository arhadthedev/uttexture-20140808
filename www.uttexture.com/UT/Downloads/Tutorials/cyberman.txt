After a bit of hacking around in the advanced configuration options, I've
configured Unreal to
work quite well with my Logitech Cyberman 2. Make these changes to the
UNREAL.INI file (or
through the little Advanced Configuration window):

----------
UNREAL.INI
----------
[Engine.Input]
JoyX=Axis astrafe speed=2
JoyY=Axis aBaseY speed=2
JoyZ=
JoyR=Axis aBaseX speed=2
JoyU=Axis aLookUp speed=2
JoyV=
[WinDrv.WindowsClient]
ScaleXYZ=1000.000000
ScaleRUV=1000.000000
----------

That's all there is to it. Given that Unreal uses DirectInput, it handles
most (if not all)
6-degrees-of-freedom controllers "natively", but the default configuration
(and default
entries in UNREAL.INI) is for the Assassin or some such controller.

Change the "speed=2" to a lower number, like "speed=1.5", to slow down the
movement, or to a
higher number, like "speed=4", to speed up the movement.

I wish Unreal had an easy-to-use option to pick from the most common "3D
controllers" like the
Cyberman and SpaceOrb 360.

By the way, does anybody have a complete list of these "Axis aMmmmmm"
commands?

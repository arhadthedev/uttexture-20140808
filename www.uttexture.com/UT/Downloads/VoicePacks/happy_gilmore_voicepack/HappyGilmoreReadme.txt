Did you like the movie "Happy Gilmore"??  Of course, who doesn't??

This voice pack contains over 30 one-liners from the movie, which 
I hope will add more enjoyment to your UT gaming experience. Since
most of them are taunts, it is more for DM than any other setting.


Warning
=======
Known bugs:  None that I know of.

This product has been built, tested, and 
found to work perfectly fine for UT v4.13.
I'm not responsible if it screws up any portion
of your computer in any way shape or form.


Installation
============
Double click the .umod file.
It's just that simple!  Now PLAY it!!!


Uninstallation
==============
There is no need to uninstall Happy Gilmore ever.
But if you ever don't want to use it, don't pick it as your voice.
Keeping it around will do you NO HARM.


Updates
=======
I am working on version 2.00 which will add all of the basic UT orders,
friendly fire comments, and acknowledgements to this voice pack.
   

Thanks to...
============
The creators of the UnrealEd program for making a great tool which 
allowed me to make this voice pack!

and to my worthy UT gaming competitors Turtle and HomerStud.


Caution
=======
This zip file containing the Happy Gilmore voice package may be 
distributed freely as long as it remains intact and is not modified
in any way. 
You may not sell or make a profit from this package.


Enjoy!!

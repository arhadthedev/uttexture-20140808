--- 1st things 1st, I Would like to Thank Rare and Nintendo for Conkers Bad Fur Day and hope you all will try it...
    Its the Best....(Had to Mix my favorite two games into one.) 
--- Also Rare really does seem to get alot of the 4 player mode (In Conkers) Ideas from UNREAL, 
    so I think they will get a kick out of this...

--- Thank you for trying this MOD, this is my FIRST go at Voice Pacs --==What you think==--. 
    So please EMail me feed back and also I will be trying a few more out. 
    Also will try others and do another Conker's (Just because there are so many one liner's that one just ain't enuff)... 
    I will keep a list of all request and EMail the new ones I make. (Number 2 is allready started)..

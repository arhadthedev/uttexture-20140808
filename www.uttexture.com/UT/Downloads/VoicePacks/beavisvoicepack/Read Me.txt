Beavis and Butthead.

A voice pack for Unreal Tournament.

Compiled by [ILAR]Grudgrbringer.

-Installation: Extract BeavisPackage.u and BeavisPackage.int to your UnrealTournament/System folder. Then open your Unrealtournament.ini also located in your UnrealTournamnet/System folder, scroll down to the [Engine.GameEngine] heading and add this line to the bottom of the existing ones:

ServerPackages=BeavisPackage

Now your all set to laugh your heads off as you kill bots, assualt bases and capture flags.

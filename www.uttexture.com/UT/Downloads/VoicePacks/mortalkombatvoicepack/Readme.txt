MORTAL KOMBAT TAUNTS v.1.2    *Updated 8.3.2000* (last version 7.3.2000)


Hey All!

Once again... Well as you see, this is the third release
of Mortal Kombat Taunts from me, version 1.2

So as i promised in the next release, i would do the rest 
of the sounds, like CTF sounds like "get the flag back" type
of things. it's almost the same as Male2Voice but
i shouted myself to the microphone, so i made myself 
a tough guy :D you'll hear it when you test this.

well enough of that crap. taunts are real MK sounds,
ctf and other sounds are made by me. i edited it with
sound forge.



but to the point. 

this release contains:

mortalkombattaunts.int         (unzip to x:\ut\system)
MortalKombatTaunts.u           (unzip to x:\ut\system)
MortalKombat.uax *sounds*           (unzip to x:\ut\Sounds)

25 Mortal Kombat 2/3 Shao Kahn Taunts
2 ScorpioN Taunts (Come Here, Get Over Here) 
34 CTF, Domination, assault etc. taunts
(for UT of course)

that's it. they fit into Unreal Tournament
damn greatly. oh yeah, and the the Instruction part:

1. unzip *.package to X:\unreal tournament\system
2. unzip *.uax to     X:\unreal tournament\sounds
3. look in X:\unreal tournament\system and locate unrealtournament.ini
   there's a line [Engine.GameEngine] and add this line 
   ServerPackages=mortalkombattaunts
4. save the changes and run UT
5. Change the voice in Player Setup. 
6. That's it, email me if you find something to be fixed.

            that should be fixed. i have tested this pack anyway.*

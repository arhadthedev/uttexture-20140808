WARNING
-------
This product has been tested and has been 
found to work perfectly fine.
I'm not responsible if it screws up any portion
of your computer in any way shape or form.



Thanks for picking up my Mr.T voice pack for Unreal Tournament.
I hope you enjoy the voices and I hope it breathes more life into
UT for you.
This is version 1.00 of the TVoice voice pack.If there will be 
another version of it,I don't know.
Keep visiting "www.bongsquaad.atfreeweb.com" for updates.


Installation
============
Run the .umod file.
It's just that simple!

Uninstallation
==============
There is no need to uninstall Tvoice ever.If you don't want to use it, don't pick it as your voice.Keeping it around will do you NO HARM.
However, if your some sort of paranoid person, you can uninstall it by doing the following...

Remove the two files created in your UnrealTournament/system folder called: 
Tvoice.u
Tvoice.int




Thanks to...
============
Genesis-X and the Play-This crew for making a great tool which 
allowed me to easily make this voice pack! (http://www.unreality.org/playthis)

The people at the "Mr.T Jibba Jabba Archive" for the sounds.

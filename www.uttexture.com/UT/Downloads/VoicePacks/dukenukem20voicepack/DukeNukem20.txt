Come visit us at UTTERANCE (http://www.geocities.com/tracker_90505/index.html


Model:  Male
uses:	Best used with the Duke Nukem Skin available at unreality.org/painfuldetail		
Content:Useful for bots and for players, contains all order sounds



Intructions

Place the .int and .u files into your Unreal Tournament system folder. Put the .uax file
into your UT sounds folder.
Make sure you have a male character selected.  Look for "Duke Nukem" under 
the voice drop down menu.  This voice replaces the previous version of the 
Dukem Nukem Voice.  


Updates to version 2.0

1.  Added order sounds - sounds that work for "defend", "assault", "cover me", etc.
2.  Added all "other" sounds- sounds that work for messages like "Somebody get our flag back" etc.
3.  Added significantly more taunts
4.  Reduced the sound quality to "telephone quality" to reduce memory usage
5.  Corrected and replaced some of the "out of place" sounding messages i.e. messages that
	just did not seem to fit like when Duke tells you to "Blow it out your ass" after
	you give him a direct order. Hilarious but just doesn't work.

Note:  I created the original Duke Nukem voice for UT (now at over 15,000 downloads, 
wooo hoo!). It took a long time to find all of the sounds for this update of the voice.  
I even found some recordings that the guy who is Duke Nukem's voice made for the upcoming 
"Duke Nukem Forever".  Have fun with it!   - Tracker

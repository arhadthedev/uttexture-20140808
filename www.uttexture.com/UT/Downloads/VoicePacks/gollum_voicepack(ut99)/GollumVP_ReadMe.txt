Gollum voicepack for UT99, from Lord of the Rings

By John DiFool

[ john.difool@earthlink.net ]

Date: 9-16-2004

Build time: 7 hours or so

7 Acks
7 Friendly Fires
18 Taunts, incl. 4 Mature Taunts
Almost all Orders and Others used too
6 "GollumDeaths"

Installation:

The .int and .u files go into your UT/system folder, while
the readme can be placed in the /help folder.

Notes:

My third effort, this time it's Gollum, from
Lord of the Rings!  My only concern was I was
able to find only 18 taunt-worthy clips, but
that is more than compensated by all the other
things-particularly hilarious are all his
various screams (see below).  All those lines
using the word "precious" work well for a CTF
game.  And yes I used several clips from the 
infamous MTV Movie Awards show... :evilgrin:

One issue is the sound distortion-Gollum's (Andy
Serkis' actually) voice is in such a high register
that translating it to parameters which will work
in UT (and without making the voicepack weigh in
at 30 megs) meant that a lot of the top end got 
distorted.  Everything is still legible tho.

Enjoy!

For servers, make sure you add this line in your
unrealtournament.cfg file:

ServerPackages=GollumVP

P.S.  There is a Gollum Bot available on Skin City:

I included 6 Gollum Deaths which you can add to any
model-simply open UnrealEd, open the desired model 
file with the Actor Class browser, open (with those
little + signs):

Pawn
    Bot
       HumanBotPlus
            GenericBot
               GenericMaleBot

And you'll find (in this case) the Gollum Bot.
Right-click and choose Default Properties, and
click on Sounds, and then Deaths.  Using the
sound browser, activate each GollumDeath in turn
(so that you can hear it), and then in the properties 
window choose _Use_ for each.  All this is purely 
optional of course.

Ack:

"NO!  That would kill us!  Kill us..."

FF:

"Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol 
     ever done to him?"

"Very nice friend oh yes my Precious very nice..."

"You don't have any friends!  Nobody likes you..."

Orders:

[Cover Me] "This way...follow me!"

Taunts:

"Who do you think you are, you f***ing hack!"

"Give it to us...raw and wrrrrigllling!" (I guess he
     likes to eat gibs as well as fish...)

"You're sadly f***ing mistaken!"

"Very nasty place..full of...enemies."

"It hates Smeagol, and makes up nasty lies!"

And a favorite of a buddy of mine:

"The Precious made us do it!"

Monty Python & the Holy Grail voicepack for UT99

By John DiFool, with a debt acknowledged to "RayGunn" Wright

[ john.difool@earthlink.net ]

Date: 9-16-2004

Build time: 5 hours or so (most of that tweaking)

3 Acks
7 Friendly Fires
26 Taunts, incl. 6 "Mature" taunts (rather mild tho)
Most Orders and Others used too

Installation:

The .int and .u files go into your UT/system folder, while
the readme can be placed in the /help folder.

After I finished my Sgt. Hartmann voice pack, I was watching
Holy Grail, when I realized there were a lot of good clips
which Raygunn didn't use.  So the result is what you see
here-probably about 60% of it has been updated and added to.
I couldn't locate Raygunn, so I hereby acknowledge his efforts
here.

For servers, make sure you add this line in your
unrealtournament.cfg file:

ServerPackages=HolyGrail

Enjoy!  [Spoilers for the new stuff I added follow]



















FF:

[Voice of God] "Now knock it off!"
"What an eccentric performance!"

Orders:

[Get Enemy Flag] "It is your Sacred Task to seek this Grail-
      that is your purpose!"

[Freelance] "We ham and jam and spamalot!" (Hee Hee-perfect!)

The monks now chant when waiting for own flag to be returned...

[God-for Hang In There] "Don't grovel! One thing I can't stand 
      is people groveling!

Taunts:

"I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of 
      2nd-hand electric donkey bottom biters!

"And if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you 
      ain't heard nothing yet!"

"So you think you could out-clever us with your silly knees-
      bent running about and prancing behavior!" (If your
      opponent likes to dodge a lot)

"Go boil your bottoms, sons-of-a-silly-person!"

And, as an added bonus, there's a couple of clips from the
      Ballad of Sir Robin (use when a lot of gibs are
      bouncing around)...

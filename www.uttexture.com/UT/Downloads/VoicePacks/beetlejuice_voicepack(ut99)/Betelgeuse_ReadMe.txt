By John DiFool

[ john.difool@earthlink.net ]

Date: 9-16-2004

Build time: 5 hours or so

3 Acks
2 Friendly Fires
19 Taunts, incl. 1 Mature Taunt
Most Orders and Others used too

Installation:

The .int and .u files go into your UT/system folder, while
the readme can be placed in the /help folder.

Notes:

Tim Burton's weird movie Beetlejuice has always been an
idiosyncratic fave of mine, and several years ago I
noticed that a lot of his lines would be perfect for
UT.  Once I got a DVD drive it was a natural choice
for a voice pack.  I could have used some clips from
the cartoon I suppose, but a) I never really cared for
it, and b) I didn't want to spring for the DVDs.  The
good news is that one of the two FFs I do have more
than compensates for the small number (see spoilers
below).  I also used a few of his bizarre screams in
appropriate places...

Enjoy!

For servers, make sure you add this line in your
unrealtournament.cfg file:

ServerPackages=Betelgeuse

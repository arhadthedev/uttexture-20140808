Thanks to the following people:

- Feralidragon, for designing after my request the 
xpickups package or how I would call it: UT3099
and thanks also to him for writting the very detailed 
manual part for "using of xpickups".

- proof for recreating the UT3 Udamage and Berserk 
Powerup Modells and an extra "thank you" for your
many plants I used mostly in Kamah. Thanks buddy,
really well done (:

- Shade for the website and the (intern) 
forums for preparing the mappack 

---=Aalexanderrr=-- for checking various readmes
for correcting of grammatic mistakes. I'm not really that good at English.
(I hope you can finish your map for the expansion pack...)

- Epic for designing UT, UT2004, UT3 and UC2, the UT series itself

- for more detailed thanksgiving check the readmes in the help
directory of the adequated authors

- thank you to the team for the good collaboration

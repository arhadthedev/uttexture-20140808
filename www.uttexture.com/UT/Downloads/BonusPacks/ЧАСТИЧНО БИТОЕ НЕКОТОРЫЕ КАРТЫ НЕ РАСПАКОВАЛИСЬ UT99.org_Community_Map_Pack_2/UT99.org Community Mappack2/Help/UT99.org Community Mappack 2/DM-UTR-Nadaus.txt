Construction
------------

                Base: Alex 1on1-Nadaus Layout, which had at the beginning 
	              only Shane Church textures.
		      And also thanks for his story
          Build Time: I guess.. 5 or 6 weeks.. again
   Ideal Playercount: 2.. maybe 3 but I think this would be to much
      Editor(s) Used: Unreal Editor 2, Photoshop CS 2, 
                      DB Amp Power Converter, Windows Audiorecorder 
                      (for increasing of the volume)
          Known Bugs: A small "sometimes appearing" HOM near the Healthcharger
		      which is near the Shock Rifle. The try to remove it makes
		      anywise everything worse, 
		      so I tried it not by hook or by crook anymore.

Extended Description
--------------------
Story by Alex:
Millenia ago, this planet, also known as RT-598J, used to be a tropical paradise. 
Its huge rainforests, massive oceans, simply eronomous mountain chains and wide variety 
of different lifeforms would definitely make a good place for exploration. 
However, NEG Mining Corporation found quite rare radioactive element that could be used for a weapon 
of mass destruction. Since then planet became a huge weapon testing site. 
Massive nuclear explosions evaporated all the rainforests and contributed to climate change.
Now that the planet has turned into cold and snowy rock whose inhabitants enjoy constant night, 
Liandri decided to take over and use one of CR's recearch labs for their Tournament.

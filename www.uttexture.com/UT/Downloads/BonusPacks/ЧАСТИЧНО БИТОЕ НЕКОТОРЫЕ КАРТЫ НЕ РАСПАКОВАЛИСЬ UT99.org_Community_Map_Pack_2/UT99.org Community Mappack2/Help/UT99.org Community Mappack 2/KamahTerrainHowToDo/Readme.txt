This small example map demostrates *the way* I used to make terrain in Kamah. 
Most of you, however, will question my decision not to write tutorial. 
Sadly, doing so is extremely hard, mainly due to the fact that reader must 
understand such things as (De)intersection, edges and vertices arrangement.

Be aware of the fact that this way of making terrain is complicated and time-consuming. 
There's no guarantee that the whole thing will be bug-free even if you have done everything correctly.  
Best solution, however, would be to learn any 3D Modelling package, for example, Blender.

And a last note - make sure that you convert t3d prefabs you have made with program called 
3D Object Converter (I have version 3.8) to AUTOCAD DXF - 3D Polygons. 
You can do that 3D Max too in case if you have it installed. 
Otherwise, try searching for something similar that can triangulate all your prefabs for a future vertex editing.

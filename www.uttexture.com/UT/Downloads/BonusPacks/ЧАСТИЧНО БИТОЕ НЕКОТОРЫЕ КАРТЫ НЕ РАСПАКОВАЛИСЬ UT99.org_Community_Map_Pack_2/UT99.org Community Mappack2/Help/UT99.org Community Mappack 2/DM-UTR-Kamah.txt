====================================================================================
Construction
------------

                Base: Built from scratch
          Build Time: started the map july 2008 at the very beginning of the 
		      mappack and ended it may 2009 
		      this includes 2 big breaks (Morbias 4 and Nadaus)
   Ideal Playercount: At least 16, I would not suggest you to play a 1on1 on this map :p
      Editor(s) Used: Unreal Editor 2, Photoshop CS 2
                      DB Amp Power Converter, Windows Audiorecorder 
                      (for increasing of the volume)
          Known Bugs: Sadly this map is full of bugs, at some point I was rather pissed.
                      I didn't succeed at removing all those bugs. After several weeks
		      of trying to fix whatever I could BSP became rather stable. 
		      I did not find any serious bugs in the end which could affect
		      the gameplay (mainly ICHs are meant). However, there's a BSP bug
		      in the sky that can be seen from a certain prespective.
		      I feel sorry for the perfectionists but I really tried my best.
		      About many longer periods I really thought this map had to be 
		      moved into the trash can, but the fact that I have already worked for months 
		       on this thing pushed me everytime 
		       towards the end .. well I guess I am anywise satisfied with the result.

Extended Description
--------------------
Story by Alex:
According to official statistics, 72 % of all shipwrecks for the last 20 years
occured in a vicinity of an island called Mehetia. Unfortunately no one knows about cause 
of those wreckages but there are several whitnesses who saw abnormal things. However, those people 
were considered mantally ill and were treated as such.

Classified Document X456RT. Subject: Thomas Skinner ( 081264 ) 

It was 2:23AM - I was smoking with my pal on the upper deck when freighter was on the move. Everything was
allright. However, several minutes later when we were almost done with out cigarettes, all 
the lights went out all of a sudden. I was rather puzzled - I have checked all the electricity
generators before and they were functioning properly... by the time I have reached Energy
Supply Room, I heard some weird noises behind me. I thought that someone of my fellow crew members
was following me but when I turned around I saw no one. That scared the crap out of me... As  soon
as I have restarted energy generators ( someone must have turned it off ), I went on the upper deck...
but I found no one. The entire crew has disappeared. At first I thought that they were playing a joke on me 
but as soon as I have found my captain's clothes, wallet with ID and more importanly his implanted bone, 
I realized that it was not a joke at all. All other crew members have disappeared. I was alone on the ship!
Off the record - I saw really strange shadows on my way out of Energy Supply Room... The last thing I remember
seeing is helicopter and sinking freighter. Am I going to get sued?  

Despite the fact that this person was transported into psychiatric nursing facility, government decided to organize a small 
outpost on that island in order to prevent such accidents in a future. However, few weeks after establishment
contact with island outpost team was lost. This time, military took over and started search and rescue operation
which has never taken place. Entire Marine squad went missing as soon as they have reached the island.

Now, ages later, this outpost is used as Tournament arena whose participants prefer to stay away from the ancient temple...

Author's Notes
--------------

From all the maps I made for this pack this is my personal favorite. I have always
wanted to make not so bad looking outdoor level so I tried myself at this big project. 
The fact that I like jungle themed map a lot and that ut1 does not have similar map
(surprise?) pushed me towards creation of this one. The goal was to make
as much jungle in ut1 as possible and, well, this is a result.  Performance sucks
a little bit .. as in any other map of mine. Still, it is quite playable.
